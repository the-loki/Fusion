# @kb/dashboard

Web-based dashboard for managing kb tasks. Provides a visual kanban board, list view, and git repository management tools.

## Features

### Planning Mode
AI-guided interactive planning for creating well-specified tasks from high-level ideas. Click the lightbulb icon in the header to start planning.

**How it works**:
1. Enter a high-level description of what you want to build (e.g., "Build a user authentication system")
2. The AI asks clarifying questions (scope, requirements, technology choices)
3. Answer questions through an interactive UI with multiple question types:
   - **Text**: Open-ended responses for detailed requirements
   - **Single Select**: Choose one option from a list (e.g., scope: small/medium/large)
   - **Multi Select**: Select multiple applicable options (e.g., features to include)
   - **Confirm**: Yes/No questions for quick decisions
4. Review the AI-generated summary with:
   - Refinable title and description
   - Size estimate (S/M/L)
   - Suggested dependencies from existing tasks
   - Key deliverables checklist
5. Create the task directly from the summary

**Features**:
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 5 planning sessions per hour per IP
- **Session Persistence**: 30-minute TTL with automatic cleanup
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicator showing question number
- **Back Navigation**: Revisit previous answers during the session
- **Example Suggestions**: Quick-start chips with common task templates
- **Dependency Selection**: Toggle existing tasks as dependencies
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through options, Enter to submit, Escape to close
- **Mobile-Safe Inputs**: Text inputs (initial plan, question responses, summary description) use 16px font size on mobile viewports to prevent browser zoom-on-focus

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/planning/start` - Begin planning session (`{ initialPlan }`)
- `POST /api/planning/respond` - Submit response (`{ sessionId, responses }`)
- `POST /api/planning/cancel` - Cancel session (`{ sessionId }`)
- `POST /api/planning/create-task` - Create task from summary (`{ sessionId }`)

### Task Management
- **Kanban Board**: Drag-and-drop task management across columns (Triage, Todo, In Progress, In Review, Done)
- **Inline Editing**: Quick-edit a task's description directly on the board for Triage and Todo columns. The editor opens as a taller multi-line editing area (4 visible lines) for comfortable editing of longer descriptions, and auto-grows to fit existing content. Double-click a card or use the pencil icon — visible on hover for desktop, always visible on mobile for touch accessibility. Inline editing changes only the description; the title is preserved. To edit both title and description, use the task detail modal.
- **Task Detail Editing**: Edit task title and description directly in the task detail modal. Click the pencil icon in the modal header (available for Triage and Todo tasks) to enter edit mode. Save and Cancel actions appear in the modal footer alongside a keyboard shortcut hint, keeping editing controls consistent with other modal action patterns.
- **List View**: Alternative tabular view for tasks with sorting and filtering. The "Hide Done" toggle hides both Done and Archived tasks for an active-work-only view.
- **Model Selection at Creation**: Choose executor and validator AI models while creating tasks from the board or list view, or leave them unset to use the global defaults. Quick-add model dropdowns in both the board triage column and the list view honor saved favorite providers and pinned models, matching the rest of the dashboard model UI.
- **AI-Assisted Creation Controls**: Plan, Subtask, and Refine buttons appear directly below the description textarea in all task creation surfaces (quick entry box, inline create card, and task form modal). These description-adjacent controls make AI-assisted creation and refinement feel directly associated with the text being edited. Deps, Models, and Save actions remain in the expanded controls footer.
- **Layered Model Dropdowns**: Shared model combobox menus render in a top-level portal attached to `document.body`, so they stay above board columns and scrollable modal content instead of being clipped behind surrounding dashboard surfaces.
- **Bulk Model Editing**: Update AI model configuration for multiple tasks at once in the list view. Select tasks via checkboxes (archived tasks excluded), then use the "Bulk Edit Models" toolbar to apply executor and/or validator model changes to all selected tasks. Selection persists in localStorage across page reloads.
- **Task Details**: View full task specifications, agent logs, and attachments. The Agent Log tab expands to fill the full modal body height above the action bar, providing maximum vertical space for watching live agent output. The tab header shows the effective executor and validator model names resolved from task-level overrides or project/global settings fallbacks, matching the same resolution order the engine uses at runtime. The refinement modal positions the "Create Refinement Task" button adjacent to the feedback textarea alongside the character count, creating a tight input group that connects the submit action directly to the text being edited.
- **Changed Files Viewer**: Click a task card's "files changed" button to open a dedicated diff viewer showing only files changed in that task worktree, with per-file statuses and sidebar navigation. On mobile (≤768px), the viewer switches to a single-pane flow: the file list and diff are shown one at a time with a back button for navigation between them. The board card file count and the changed-files viewer always agree — both use the same merge-base diff strategy, so the card never advertises files that the viewer cannot inspect
- **GitHub Import**: Import issues directly from GitHub repositories
- **PR Management**: Create, monitor, and merge pull requests for in-review tasks

### Responsive Header
The dashboard header adapts across three responsive tiers to remain usable without wrapping or dropping controls:

- **Mobile (≤768px)**: Lower-priority actions (GitHub Import, Planning, Settings, and optionally Usage) move into an accessible overflow menu triggered by a "More actions" button. The menu closes on outside click, Escape key, or after selecting an action. When multiple projects are registered, a dedicated "Switch Project" entry (building icon) appears in the overflow menu, distinct from the folder icon used for file browsing. The Terminal overflow item is a split action: the left/primary tap opens the terminal immediately, while the right-side chevron expands a nested submenu listing runnable scripts fetched from the project's script settings. Tapping a script entry runs it directly via the terminal; a "Manage Scripts…" link at the bottom of the submenu opens the full script editor when available. The board search input collapses to an icon button; tapping it expands a focused search field that stays visible while a query is active. The project selector and back button are hidden to save space. View toggle (Board/List), Pause, and Stop buttons remain inline for immediate access.
- **Tablet (769px–1024px)**: The header uses a compact layout that keeps the view toggle, search input, and both engine controls (Pause/Resume scheduling and Stop/Start AI engine) inline at all times. Lower-priority utility actions (GitHub Import, Planning, Settings, Usage) move into the overflow menu so the engine controls never disappear. The Terminal overflow item uses the same split-action pattern as mobile: primary tap opens terminal, chevron expands the scripts submenu with runnable entries and a "Manage Scripts…" link. The project selector and back button are hidden on tablet, but the overflow menu includes the same "Switch Project" entry when multiple projects are registered.
- **Desktop (>1024px)**: Full header with all controls and the project selector inline. No overflow menu.
- **Keyboard Accessible**: All controls across tiers expose proper ARIA attributes (aria-expanded, aria-haspopup, aria-label) and support keyboard navigation.

### Mobile Task Entry
Task entry inputs (the quick entry box in the Triage column and the New Task modal's description field) are sized to prevent browser zoom-on-focus on iOS Safari. On mobile viewports (≤768px), these inputs use a minimum 16px font size, which keeps the viewport stable when users focus the fields.

### Executor Status Bar
A persistent footer status bar at the bottom of the dashboard displays real-time executor statistics in project view. The status bar provides immediate visibility into the engine's state without opening modals or hovering over badges.

**Statistics Displayed**:
- **Running**: Count of tasks currently in "in-progress" column with pulsing animation when > 0
- **Blocked**: Count of tasks with `blockedBy` field set (a single task ID string indicating file-overlap blocking)
- **Stuck**: Count of tasks in "in-progress" with no activity for > 10 minutes (shown only when > 0)
- **Queued**: Count of tasks in "todo" column
- **In Review**: Count of tasks in "in-review" column
- **Executor State**: Current state badge (Idle/Running/Paused)
- **Last Activity**: Relative timestamp of most recent task event

**State Mapping**:
- **Idle**: Global pause enabled, OR engine paused with no running tasks
- **Paused**: Engine paused with running tasks
- **Running**: Engine active with running tasks

**Features**:
- **Shared task list**: Task counts are derived from the same task list used by the board and list views, so the footer always matches the board state exactly
- **Footer-safe layout**: Project-view content (board, list view, agents view) automatically reserves space for the fixed footer using a CSS custom property (`--executor-footer-height`). The `project-content--with-footer` wrapper class sets this token to 36px on desktop and 32px on mobile, ensuring all content remains fully visible and scrollable above the status bar
- Real-time updates via 5-second polling for executor state (globalPause, enginePaused, maxConcurrent)
- Responsive design: collapses labels on mobile screens (<768px); footer height reduces from 36px to 32px
- Dark/light theme support via CSS variables
- Error state shows connection issues
- Only visible in project view, not in overview/project selector

**API Endpoint**:
- `GET /api/executor/stats` - Returns `globalPause`, `enginePaused`, `maxConcurrent`, and `lastActivityAt` for state derivation. Column-based counts (running, blocked, stuck, queued, in-review) are derived client-side from the shared task list.

### Agents View
Manage AI agents with a dedicated control surface accessible from the main dashboard navigation.

**Features**:
- **State Filter**: Styled dropdown to filter agents by state (All States, Idle, Active, Paused, Terminated) with icon and consistent dashboard styling
- **View Modes**: Board (compact grid) and list (detailed card) layouts, persisted to localStorage
- **Agent CRUD**: Create agents with name and role, change state, update roles inline, delete terminated agents
- **Health Monitoring**: Heartbeat-based health status (Healthy, Unresponsive, Starting, Paused, Terminated)
- **Agent Detail**: Click any agent card to open a detail modal with full agent information

### Interactive Terminal
Access a fully functional PTY (pseudo-terminal) shell directly from the dashboard. Click the terminal icon in the header to open the interactive terminal modal.

**Features**:
- **Real PTY Terminal**: Spawns a real shell (bash/zsh/powershell) using node-pty for authentic terminal behavior
- **Bidirectional Communication**: WebSocket connection for instant input/output
- **xterm.js Integration**: Full terminal emulation with proper ANSI support, colors, and cursor handling
- **Auto-resizing**: Terminal automatically fits to container size
- **Scrollback Buffer**: 5KB of scrollback history with replay on reconnect
- **Reconnection Support**: Automatic reconnect with exponential backoff if connection drops
- **Reliable Prompt Delivery**: Initial shell prompt visible through first keyst press
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Ctrl+C` - Send SIGINT to process (copy if text selected)
  - `Ctrl+V` - Paste from clipboard
  - `Ctrl+L` - Clear terminal screen
  - `Ctrl++` / `Ctrl+-` - Zoom in/out
  - `Ctrl+0` - Reset zoom
  - `Escape` - Close terminal modal

### Script Run Dialog
When running a saved script from the dashboard (via QuickScripts dropdown in the header or the Run button in Scripts modal), the Scripts modal closes immediately and a dedicated ScriptRunDialog becomes the active foreground view with live output streaming. The dialog uses the existing terminal PTY session infrastructure:
 WebSocket connection for output, but is non-interactive (no user input).

**Modal Handoff**: When a script is launched from the Scripts modal, the modal dismisses synchronously before the API call completes so that the ScriptRunDialog always appears as the topmost surface — the user never sees both overlays stacked at once.
  - **Live Output**: Streams stdout/stderr from the script in real-time via WebSocket
  - **Script Name & Command**: Shows the script name and resolved command
  - **Status Indicator**: Shows running/completed/error status
  - **Exit Code**: Displays exit code when the script completes
  - **Clean Closure**: Kills the backing PTY session if closed while still running

**Features**:
- **Real PTY Terminal**: Spawns a real shell (bash/zsh/powershell) using node-pty for authentic terminal behavior
- **Bidirectional Communication**: WebSocket connection for instant input/output
- **xterm.js Integration**: Full terminal emulation with proper ANSI support, colors, and cursor handling
- **Auto-resizing**: Terminal automatically fits to container size
- **Scrollback Buffer**: 50KB of scrollback history with replay on reconnect
- **Reconnection Support**: Automatic reconnect with exponential backoff if connection drops
- **Reliable Prompt Delivery**: Initial shell prompt and first keystrokes are always visible — output is preserved across the WebSocket connection, xterm initialization, and resize lifecycle without loss or duplication

**Keyboard Shortcuts**:
- `Ctrl+C` - Send SIGINT to process (copy if text selected)
- `Ctrl+V` - Paste from clipboard
- `Ctrl+L` - Clear terminal screen
- `Ctrl++` / `Ctrl+-` - Zoom in/out
- `Ctrl+0` - Reset zoom
- `Escape` - Close terminal modal

**Security**:
- Working directory restricted to project root (path traversal protection)
- Environment variable sanitization (PORT, DATA_DIR, GITHUB_TOKEN, etc. stripped)
- Session ID validation (alphanumeric only)
- Input sanitization (null bytes rejected)
- Shell allowlist validation

**Session Management**:
- Sessions persist while modal is open
- Maximum 10 concurrent sessions per user (configurable)
- Sessions can be restarted when shell exits
- Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM, then SIGKILL fallback

### Git Manager
The Git Manager provides comprehensive repository visualization and management directly from the web UI. Access it via the Git Branch icon button in the header (desktop: inline with other utility buttons, mobile: in the overflow menu).
- **Safety Validation**: Dangerous commands (rm -rf /, etc.) are automatically blocked
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Enter` - Execute command
  - `Up/Down` - Navigate command history
  - `Ctrl+C` - Kill running process
  - `Ctrl+L` - Clear screen
  - `Esc` - Close terminal

**Supported Commands**: git, npm/pnpm/yarn, ls, cat, echo, pwd, cd, mkdir, touch, cp, mv, rm, head, tail, find, grep, curl, wget, node, npx, python, make, and more.

**Status Badge**: When tasks are "in-progress", the terminal button shows a badge with the count.

**Status Tab**: View current repository state including:
- Current branch name and commit hash
- Working directory status (clean/dirty)
- Ahead/behind counts relative to remote

**Commits Tab**: Browse recent commits with:
- Commit list with message, author, and date
- Expandable diff view for each commit
- Pagination support (load more commits)

**Branches Tab**: Manage local branches:
- List all branches with current indicator
- Create new branches with optional base
- Checkout existing branches
- Delete branches (with confirmation)

**Worktrees Tab**: Visualize worktree layout:
- List all worktrees with paths
- See which tasks own which worktrees
- Identify main vs linked worktrees
- Track free/used worktree count

**Remotes Tab**: Perform remote operations:
- Fetch from origin
- Pull latest changes
- Push current branch
- View operation results and error states

### File Browser
Browse and edit task worktree files directly from the task detail modal:

- **Files Tab**: Available when a task has a worktree assigned
- **File Tree**: Navigate directories with breadcrumb-style path display
- **Text Editor**: Edit files with a clean textarea-based editor
  - Supports all text files with automatic syntax detection
  - **Markdown Preview**: Toggle between edit and preview modes for `.md`, `.markdown`, and `.mdx` files
  - One-dark theme matching the dashboard
- **Safety Features**:
  - Path traversal prevention (blocks `..` patterns)
  - Binary file detection (prevents editing images, executables, etc.)
  - 1MB file size limit
  - Unsaved change indicators
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Ctrl/Cmd+S` to save
  - `Escape` to close

### Activity Log
View a centralized timeline of all task lifecycle events. Click the history icon in the header to open the Activity Log modal.

**Data Source**:
- **Single-project mode** (default): Reads from the per-project activity log via `/api/activity`, which is always populated with task lifecycle events for the current project.
- **Multi-project mode**: When projects are registered, the modal reads from the unified central feed via `/api/activity-feed`, which aggregates activity across all registered projects. A project filter dropdown allows narrowing results to a specific project.

**Features**:
- **Event Types**: Track task:created, task:moved, task:merged, task:failed, task:deleted, and settings:updated events
- **Task Links**: Click any task ID in the log to open its detail modal
- **Filter by Type**: Use the dropdown to show only specific event types (e.g., only failures, only merges)
- **Auto-refresh**: Log updates automatically every 30 seconds when the modal is open
- **Pagination**: "Load More" button fetches older entries (100 entries per request, max 1000)
- **Clear Log**: Maintenance function to clear all activity history (with confirmation)
- **Responsive Layout**: On narrow screens (≤768px), the modal adapts with a stacked header, full-width filter controls, wrapped active-filters bar, reflowed entry text, and vertically stacked confirmation actions — preserving access to filters, task links, and clear-log on mobile devices

**Event Metadata**:
- Task moves show from/to column transitions
- Merges show success/failure status
- Failures include error messages when available

**Keyboard Shortcuts**:
- `Escape` - Close modal (or cancel confirmation dialog)

**API Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/activity` - Get activity log entries with optional limit, since, and type filters
- `DELETE /api/activity` - Clear all activity log entries

### Configuration
- **Settings Modal**: Configure scheduling, worktrees, build commands, merge preferences, notifications, and appearance
- **Error Recovery**: If settings fail to load, the modal displays an inline error message with a retry button instead of getting stuck on "Loading…"
- **Settings API Contract**: Server-owned fields like `githubTokenConfigured` are injected on GET /settings but stripped on PUT /settings to prevent persistence to config.json
- **Notifications**: ntfy.sh integration for push notifications when tasks complete or fail
- **Authentication**: OAuth provider management for AI model access
- **Pause Controls**: Soft pause (stop new work) and hard stop (kill all agents)
- **Theming**: Light/dark/system mode toggle and 12 color themes (see Theming section below)

### Merge strategies

The dashboard exposes two automated completion strategies in Settings:

- **Direct merge** *(default)* — preserves existing behavior. When `autoMerge` is enabled, kb merges in-review tasks locally.
- **Pull request** — when `autoMerge` is enabled, kb creates or links a PR for the task branch, keeps the task in **In Review** while waiting on GitHub policy, and merges the PR when it is ready.

`autoMerge` is still the master switch for automation. Turning it off disables both direct merge and PR-first auto-completion.

### PR-first workflow notes

When the merge strategy is **Pull request**:

- The task's PR section shows whether kb is waiting on checks/reviews or has merged successfully
- Required checks must pass before kb merges the PR; optional checks do not block auto-merge
- A blocking review state (for example, active changes requested) prevents auto-merge until cleared
- Closed PRs do not auto-merge
- GitHub access must be available via `gh auth login` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- kb expects the task branch to already be pushed using the standard branch name `kb/<task-id-lower>`

**Non-goal:** the dashboard does not implicitly push branches before PR creation. Use your normal git workflow or automation to publish task branches first.

## Theming

The dashboard supports a comprehensive theming system with both light/dark mode and color theme options.

### Theme Modes
- **Dark** (default): Classic dark theme, GitHub-inspired
- **Light**: Light backgrounds with dark text
- **System**: Automatically follows your operating system preference

Toggle between modes using the theme button in the header (cycles Dark → Light → System) or select from the Appearance section in Settings.

### Color Themes
Choose from 12 distinct color palettes in the Appearance settings:

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Default** | Classic blue accent colors (GitHub-inspired) |
| **Ocean** | Deep blues with cyan accents |
| **Forest** | Deep greens with emerald accents |
| **Sunset** | Warm oranges and reds |
| **Berry** | Purple/pink tones |
| **Monochrome** | Pure grayscale |
| **High Contrast** | Extreme contrast for accessibility |
| **Solarized** | Classic solarized palette |

### Theme Persistence
Theme preferences are automatically saved to localStorage and persist across sessions. The effective theme is applied immediately to prevent flash of unstyled content.

### Adding New Themes
To add a new color theme:

1. Add the theme to `COLOR_THEMES` in `packages/core/src/types.ts`
2. Add CSS variables in `packages/dashboard/app/styles.css` under `[data-color-theme="your-theme"]`
3. Add the swatch class for the theme picker in the CSS
4. Update `ThemeSelector.tsx` with the new theme option

## Performance Characteristics

The dashboard includes several runtime safeguards to stay responsive during long sessions and on larger boards:

- **Agent log cap**: The UI keeps only the most recent **500 agent log entries per task** in memory. Historical log fetches and live SSE appends are both truncated to this window.
- **Memoized task rendering**: `TaskCard`, `Column`, and worktree grouping are memoized so unrelated SSE updates do not force the whole board to repaint. The board also preserves stable per-column task arrays for unchanged columns.
- **Large-column pagination**: Columns with more than **100 tasks** use incremental client-side pagination, rendering **50 tasks initially** and loading **25 more** at a time. This is applied to active non-archived, non-`in-progress` columns to avoid breaking worktree grouping and archived browsing behavior.
- **Badge update isolation**: Live GitHub PR/issue badge websocket updates are rendered through a dedicated child component so badge freshness is preserved even when task cards are memoized.
- **SSE cleanup and reconnects**: Task and log streaming hooks explicitly clean up EventSource listeners/connections, automatically refetch the task snapshot after a stream reconnect, and avoid duplicate stream setup during rerenders.
- **Foreground recovery refresh**: The task board refreshes its task snapshot when the browser tab becomes visible again so long-lived hidden tabs do not keep showing stale board/list data after missed live events.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### Strict TypeScript Verification

The dashboard enforces strict type-checking via `src/__tests__/typecheck.test.ts`, which runs `pnpm typecheck` to verify the workspace type-checks cleanly from a clean checkout. The test temporarily moves any existing `dist/` directories to ensure type resolution happens against source files, not stale build artifacts. This ensures type safety across the workspace and catches missing or incompatible types in dependencies without requiring a full build first.

**Contributor Verification Requirements**

Dashboard changes must keep both test suites green:

```bash
cd packages/dashboard && pnpm test      # Run all dashboard tests
cd packages/dashboard && pnpm typecheck # Run dashboard typecheck
```

The terminal hook tests (`app/hooks/useTerminal.test.ts`) and typecheck regression suite (`src/__tests__/typecheck.test.ts`) are intentionally active — do not skip these tests. Any changes that break type safety or test coverage will fail the CI gate.

### Workspace Type Checking

From the repository root, validate all packages without building:

```bash
pnpm typecheck                  # Type-check all packages from clean checkout
```

This works by configuring packages to resolve their workspace dependencies via TypeScript's module resolution against source files. The dashboard's own `typecheck` script runs both server (`src/`) and client (`app/`) type checks.

## API Endpoints

The dashboard server exposes a REST API at `/api`:

### Interactive Terminal (PTY/WebSocket)
- `POST /api/terminal/sessions` - Create PTY session (`{ cwd?, cols?, rows? }`) → `{ sessionId, shell, cwd }`
- `GET /api/terminal/sessions` - List active sessions → `[{ id, cwd, shell, createdAt }]`
- `DELETE /api/terminal/sessions/:id` - Kill session → `{ killed }`
- `WS /api/terminal/ws?sessionId=xxx` - WebSocket for bidirectional I/O

### Interactive Terminal (Legacy SSE - Deprecated)
- `POST /api/terminal/exec` - Execute command (`{ command }`) → `{ sessionId }` (legacy)
- `GET /api/terminal/sessions/:id/stream` - SSE stream (legacy)

### GitHub Integration
- `GET /api/git/remotes` - List GitHub remotes
- `POST /api/github/issues/fetch` - Fetch issues (`{ owner, repo, limit?, labels? }`)
- `POST /api/github/issues/import` - Import issue (`{ owner, repo, issueNumber }`)
- `POST /api/github/webhooks` - GitHub App webhook endpoint for badge updates (see GitHub App Setup below)
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/pr/create` - Create PR
- `GET /api/tasks/:id/pr/status` - Get PR status (5-min staleness, auto background refresh)
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/pr/refresh` - Force refresh PR status
- `GET /api/tasks/:id/issue/status` - Get cached issue status (5-min staleness, auto background refresh)
- `POST /api/tasks/:id/issue/refresh` - Force refresh issue status
- `WS /api/ws` - Real-time PR/issue badge updates for subscribed task cards

### GitHub App Setup for Badge Webhooks

For real-time PR/issue badge updates, configure a GitHub App instead of relying on polling:

**Environment Variables:**
- `FUSION_GITHUB_APP_ID` - Your GitHub App ID
- `FUSION_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` - PEM private key content (or use `FUSION_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`)
- `FUSION_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` - Path to PEM private key file (alternative to direct key)
- `FUSION_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook secret for signature verification

**GitHub App Configuration:**
- **Permissions Required:**
  - Metadata: Read
  - Pull requests: Read
  - Issues: Read
- **Webhook Events:** Subscribe to `pull_request`, `issues`, and `issue_comment` events
- **Webhook URL:** `https://your-dashboard-url/api/github/webhooks`

**How it Works:**
1. GitHub sends signed webhook events when PR/issue state changes
2. Server verifies `X-Hub-Signature-256` using `FUSION_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
3. Server fetches canonical badge data using GitHub App installation token
4. Matching tasks (by parsed badge URL) are updated via `store.updatePrInfo()` / `store.updateIssueInfo()`
5. `task:updated` event triggers `/api/ws` broadcast to subscribed clients
6. No duplicate broadcasts when only `lastCheckedAt` timestamp changes

**Fallback Behavior:**
When webhook delivery is unavailable, the 5-minute refresh endpoints (`/api/tasks/:id/pr/status`, `/api/tasks/:id/issue/status`) continue to work as the fallback path. Staleness is computed from persisted `lastCheckedAt` timestamps only (no in-memory poller state).

### Multi-Instance Deployments

When running the dashboard on multiple instances behind a load balancer, badge updates can be shared across instances using Redis pub/sub. This ensures that a PR/issue badge change detected on instance A is delivered to subscribed WebSocket clients on instance B.

**Configuration:**
- `FUSION_BADGE_PUBSUB_REDIS_URL` - Redis connection URL (e.g., `redis://localhost:6379`)
- `FUSION_BADGE_PUBSUB_CHANNEL` - Pub/sub channel name (default: `fusion:badge-updates`)

When `FUSION_BADGE_PUBSUB_REDIS_URL` is not set, the dashboard uses an in-memory adapter for single-instance deployments.

**Design Notes:**
- Webhook deliveries to any instance are broadcast to all instances via pub/sub
- WebSocket message format unchanged: `{ type: "badge:updated", taskId, prInfo?, issueInfo?, timestamp }`
- Echo prevention: origin instances ignore their own pub/sub messages via source ID deduplication
- Late subscribers receive the current cached snapshot from their connected instance

### PTY Terminal (WebSocket-based)
- `POST /api/terminal/sessions` - Create session
- `GET /api/terminal/sessions` - List sessions
- `DELETE /api/terminal/sessions/:id` - Kill session
- `WS /api/terminal/ws` - WebSocket connection

### Configuration
- `GET /api/config` - Server configuration
- `GET /api/settings` - Merged settings (project overrides global)
- `PUT /api/settings` - Update project-level settings (rejects global-only fields)
- `GET /api/settings/global` - Global user settings (~/.pi/fusion/settings.json)
- `PUT /api/settings/global` - Update global user settings
- `GET /api/settings/scopes` - Settings separated by scope: { global, project }
- `GET /api/models` - Available AI models
- `GET /api/auth/status` - OAuth provider status
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Initiate OAuth login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout from provider

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + Vite, TypeScript, xterm.js for terminal emulation, CSS custom properties for theming
- **Backend**: Express server with REST API, badge WebSocket at `/api/ws`, terminal WebSocket at `/api/terminal/ws`, and Server-Sent Events (SSE) for task/log updates
- **Terminal**: node-pty for PTY spawning, WebSocket for bidirectional I/O
- **Badge Updates**: `useBadgeWebSocket()` shares a single browser socket and subscribes per visible GitHub-linked task card
- **State Management**: Custom hooks with EventSource for real-time task updates plus a dedicated WebSocket store for badge snapshots
- **Git Integration**: Server-side git command execution with validation
