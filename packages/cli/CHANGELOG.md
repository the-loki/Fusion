# @runfusion/fusion

## 0.8.1

### Patch Changes

- a8dbdbc: Include linked GitHub issue references (`Ref: owner/repo#N`) in executor and merger commit message instructions and merger fallback commits when tasks are sourced from GitHub issues.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 58510e1: Add CLI support for multi-node routing: configure project default node (`fn settings set defaultNodeId`), unavailable-node policy (`fn settings set unavailableNodePolicy`), per-task node overrides (`fn task set-node`, `fn task clear-node`), and `--node` flag for `fn task create`.
- 81c6f01: Add node routing policy enforcement: when a task is routed to a node that is offline or unhealthy, the project's `unavailableNodePolicy` setting controls whether execution is blocked (task stays in todo) or falls back to local execution. Supports `defaultNodeId` project setting for pinned default nodes and per-task `nodeId` overrides. Routing decisions are logged to task activity for visibility.
- c9241d8: Add pluggable notification provider system with built-in ntfy and webhook support.
- 22bac2d: Refactor merge conflict strategies into two `smart-*` flavors and change the default to "prefer main".

  Both smart strategies now run a best-effort `git fetch` + fast-forward of local main from `origin` before the merge cascade — a freshly-pushed sibling commit no longer gets clobbered when the fallback resolves a conflict against a stale base. They differ only in the per-file final fallback:

  - **`smart-prefer-main`** (new default): `-X ours` — main wins. Best when concurrent agents could regress just-merged sibling work.
  - **`smart-prefer-branch`**: `-X theirs` — task branch wins. Equivalent to the previous `"smart"` behavior.

  Legacy enum values are accepted for backwards compatibility and normalized at load time: `"smart"` → `"smart-prefer-branch"`, `"prefer-main"` → `"smart-prefer-main"`. Settings on disk continue to work without changes.

### Patch Changes

- f19ecac: Add dedicated POST /api/memory/dream endpoint and triggerMemoryDreams() client helper for manual dream processing.
- cc9181d: Recover automatically from SQLite FTS5 corruption during task upserts by rebuilding the `tasks_fts` index and retrying once, and add FTS5 integrity checks to database health monitoring.
- 5cc7597: Fix npm bundle reliability for the published CLI package by removing the vendored pi-claude-cli `cross-spawn` runtime dependency, validating bundled pi-claude-cli resolution from `dist/`, and preventing private `@fusion/*` workspace dev dependencies from leaking into the packed manifest.
- 2029968: Fix project-level model overrides so they take precedence over the default model fallback consistently across dashboard and engine AI flows.
- cd03c6a: Add runfusion.ai links to dashboard update-available notices in the banner and settings modal.
- 7227b87: Add a retry button to failed task error boxes on dashboard task cards so users can retry directly from the card without opening task details.
- 198f85c: Fix dashboard onboarding: the "Welcome to Fusion" setup wizard is now scrollable on short viewports (older laptops / browsers without `dvh` support), and the model-onboarding modal reliably opens after the wizard closes on a fresh install instead of racing it or being suppressed.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- ce6dcef: fix(0.7.1): mobile polish, modal layout fixes, paperclip CLI parity, schema migration

  Mobile / dashboard:

  - ModelOnboardingModal: dialog was off-screen on phones because the desktop `min-width: 640px` won over the mobile `max-width: 100%`. Reset min-width/min-height to 0 in the mobile media query (with `!important` so persisted desktop sizes from `useModalResizePersist` cannot re-pin it). Compact provider cards: keep the icon inline beside the name + description, shrink the icon container, drop name/description font sizes, and rely on flex-wrap so the API-key actions still drop to their own row underneath. The API-key input + Save button now live on a single row at the full card width — input grows left-aligned, Save shrinks to the right with a hairline of inline padding.
  - NewAgentDialog: the dialog's top was rendering hidden behind the in-page Agents header on mobile. Render the dialog through `createPortal(..., document.body)` so the overlay escapes the `.agents-view` stacking context. Mobile media query also drops the overlay padding, fills 100vw / 100dvh with safe-area insets on header/footer for iOS notch + home indicator, and fixes the classic flex `min-height: auto` bug that prevented `overflow-y: auto` on the body from activating.
  - TerminalModal: same root cause as the onboarding modal — desktop `min-width: 480px` / `min-height: 320px` pinned the modal off-screen on phones. Reset to 0 in the mobile rule with `!important` so persisted desktop sizes can't override.
  - WorkflowStepManager: fix React error #310 ("Rendered more hooks than during the previous render") that prevented the workflow steps panel from loading. `useOverlayDismiss` was being called after an `if (!isOpen) return null` early return, so the hook count differed between open/closed renders. Moved the hook above the early return.
  - SettingsModal auth panel: tightened `.auth-panel-body` horizontal padding from `--space-xl` (24px) to `--space-md` (12px), giving each provider card more horizontal room.

  Paperclip runtime:

  - CLI parity: in the dashboard's "Local CLI" tab, Test / fetch companies / fetch agents now actually shell out to `paperclipai` instead of making HTTP calls through a derived URL. New CLI-backed variants (`probePaperclipViaCli`, `listCompaniesViaCli`, `listCompanyAgentsViaCli`, `createIssueViaCli`, `getIssueViaCli`, `agentsMeViaCli`) drive every Paperclip call that has a CLI counterpart; the runtime adapter routes through them when `transport=cli`. `getIssueComments` / `wakeAgent` / `getRunEvents` continue using HTTP (no matching `paperclipai` subcommands) but rely on the apiKey discovered from the local paperclipai config so CLI mode works end-to-end.
  - New dashboard routes `/providers/paperclip/cli-status`, `/cli-companies`, `/cli-agents` exposing the CLI helpers.

  Plugin runtime registry:

  - `GET /api/plugins/runtimes` now merges a bundled hermes/openclaw/paperclip fallback list on top of installed plugins, so the NewAgentDialog "Plugin Runtime" dropdown populates without requiring `fn plugin install` on a fresh setup. Installed plugins override the bundled entry by `runtimeId`. Coalesced the optional `version` field to `"0.0.0"` to satisfy the bundled-runtime type.

  Core:

  - Schema migration fix: bumped `SCHEMA_VERSION` from 48 → 49 so migration 49 (per-task `nodeId` column for remote-node routing) actually runs. Existing DBs at version 48 hit the early-return guard, never created the column, and `TaskStore.listTasks` crashed at startup with `no such column: nodeId` — the dashboard exited before initialization. The bump unblocks app startup on any pre-existing 0.7.0 install.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- b30e017: feat(runtimes): real Hermes / OpenClaw / Paperclip runtime plugins

  Replaces the stub runtime plugins with end-to-end working integrations:

  - **Hermes** runtime drives the local `hermes` CLI as a subprocess (`hermes chat -q ... -Q --source tool [--resume <id>]`), captures session ids for continuity, with profile picker (HERMES_HOME-based switching) and Nous Research co-brand.
  - **OpenClaw** runtime drives `openclaw --no-color agent --local --json --session-id <uuid> --message <prompt>`, parses the OpenAI-compatible JSON output, surfaces visible/reasoning text via callbacks; defaults to embedded mode (no daemon required).
  - **Paperclip** runtime now uses the modern `POST /api/agents/{id}/wakeup` + heartbeat-run streaming API (replaces the old issue-checkout + heartbeat-invoke flow); supports both API mode (URL + bearer) and CLI mode (auto-derives URL from `~/.paperclip/instances/default/config.json`); company + agent dropdowns; CLI key bootstrap via `paperclipai agent local-cli`.

  Engine fix: `agent-session-helpers.ts:createResolvedAgentSession` now attaches the resolved runtime's `promptWithFallback` to the session so pi's dispatch hook routes prompts through the plugin runtime instead of falling through to pi's native path.

  Dashboard adds a unified `RuntimeCardShell` component, real provider logos (caduceus, pixel-lobster, paperclip outline), Test/Save/Save & Test buttons with success/failure toasts, "Learn more →" links, and a "Runtimes" group in Settings.

  Backend adds `GET /providers/{hermes,openclaw,paperclip}/status`, `GET /providers/hermes/profiles`, `GET /providers/paperclip/{companies,agents,cli-discovery}`, `POST /providers/paperclip/cli-mint-key`.

  Plugin SDK: now ships a proper `dist/` build (was previously TS-source-only), unblocking runtime imports from compiled plugins.

### Patch Changes

- ec09282: Add dashboard vitest process controls with a new `POST /api/kill-vitest` endpoint and System Stats modal UI for manual kills plus auto-kill settings management.
- 92b8631: Fix automation execution pipeline reliability by improving ProjectEngine automation startup diagnostics and health visibility, adding due-schedule regression coverage, and fixing manual automation runs to execute ai-prompt and create-task steps (including continueOnFailure handling) instead of command-only behavior.
- 8fbd3bd: Fix plugin-install loader taskStore compatibility by ensuring CLI plugin install paths are covered with regression tests for `getRootDir` expectations.
- 347cae8: Load enabled plugins during dashboard, serve, and daemon startup so plugin runtimes are available to agent runtime selection immediately after boot.
- 0a5dcf1: Fix `/api/system-stats` so process/system metrics still return when project resolution fails, with task and agent aggregates gracefully falling back to zero counts.
- 3c8a490: Fix `fn plugin install` failing in CLI plugin commands by adding `getRootDir()` to the mock TaskStore used by `createPluginLoader`.
- 637f435: Fix pi-claude-cli planning hangs by simplifying custom MCP tool guidance to direct `mcp__custom-tools__*` calls (no `ToolSearch` prerequisite), aligning custom-tool handling diagnostics, and adding regression coverage for `ls`/triage MCP tool mapping behavior.
- 7691bab: Respect globalPause/enginePaused in heartbeat trigger scheduler and monitor to prevent agents from running when the engine is paused at startup.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- f4d98ed: Add a `--git` flag to `fn init` to auto-initialize a git repository (including an initial commit) when the target directory is not already a git repo.
- 6caab17: Add project settings to auto-comment on imported GitHub issues when tasks move to done, plus dashboard GitHub integration support for posting issue comments.
- fdf8ca9: Reframe the CLI splash to "multi node agent orchestrator" with `runfusion.ai` and the current version, and surface the version alongside URL/host/auth/uptime in the dashboard System panel and status bar.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- b969635: v0.5.0: status terminology refresh (planning/replan), Reviewer rename, in-review pause behavior, dashboard-tui resize hardening, dev-server experimental toggle fix, and version reporting fix.

### Patch Changes

- 112ad67: Fix experimental feature save normalization so disabling Dev Server clears the legacy `devServer` alias (`null` delete) alongside canonical `devServerView`, preventing stale nav visibility after save.
- 16ec204: Fix dashboard health/version reporting to read the version from package.json instead of relying on npm_package_version with a stale hardcoded fallback.
- 79ce48c: Fix pausing behavior for in-review tasks so stop fully halts merge activity. Paused in-review tasks are now marked with paused status, removed from merge queues, active merge sessions are aborted/disposed, self-healing recovery skips paused tasks, and unpausing re-enqueues eligible review tasks for auto-merge.
- c85ffa9: Rename status values: specifying→planning, needs-respecify→needs-replan. Display label "Triage"→"Planning". Includes DB migration for existing records.
- 03a48ae: Update dashboard and CLI status strings: specifying→planning, needs-respecify→needs-replan. Update user-facing text from "triage/specify" terminology to "planning/replan" terminology.
- c1b0121: Rename "Validator" to "Reviewer" across all dashboard UI labels and descriptions.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- b5200ba: Add Cloudflare Quick Tunnel mode for Remote Access so Fusion can auto-provision an ephemeral `trycloudflare.com` URL via `cloudflared tunnel --url` without requiring a pre-created named tunnel or tunnel token.
- 8097db2: Rename status values: specifying→planning, needs-respecify→needs-replan. Display label "Triage"→"Planning". Includes DB migration for existing records.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9d8852e: Add project-level overlap ignore paths so teams can exempt safe shared files/directories from overlap-based task serialization while keeping overlap protection enabled for the rest of the repo.

### Patch Changes

- f560af5: Fix dashboard TUI agents view run history rendering to use readable status labels and allow opening selected run logs reliably.
- cd4cef3: Fix dashboard TUI agent run-log opening so Enter key presses sent as carriage-return/newline characters are recognized reliably.
- 7e05a20: Speed up `fn init` project-name detection by skipping git remote lookup when the target directory is not a git repository. This avoids unnecessary subprocess work and reduces timeout risk in test/CI environments.
- c818d71: Inset plugin manager cards from the modal edges on mobile. The plugins subsection panel had no horizontal padding while its heading and toggle were already inset, leaving cards flush with the modal frame on small screens.
- c818d71: Fix triage hangs when using pi-claude-cli with claude-sonnet-4-6. Parameterless custom tools (e.g. `fn_review_spec`) emit zero `input_json_delta` events from the Claude CLI, so the event bridge previously fell through to a raw empty-string fallback and pi's TypeBox validator rejected the call with "root: must be object" — looping the agent indefinitely. Defaults empty `partialJson` to `{}`. Also adds a reminder loop before the planning fallback model engages, propagates the bundled `@runfusion/fusion` extension into engine sessions so `fn_*` tools register without `pi install`, and drops the "historical" qualifier from replayed tool labels that was confusing models into treating their own prior turns as a previous session.
- ff6a68b: Fix Skills Catalog initial-load failures by preventing unauthenticated public search requests for empty or too-short queries. The dashboard now returns a successful empty catalog result for short-query unauthenticated/fallback states instead of surfacing upstream 400 errors.
- 1b3994f: Fix the dashboard terminal modal desktop width contract so large displays use a broad viewport-based layout, and harden terminal input lifecycle handling so xterm keyboard input continues forwarding reliably after rerenders.
- 1a8058f: Make agent pause/resume state transitions act immediately by stopping active heartbeat runs on pause and triggering an on-demand heartbeat on resume.
- 39622f0: Fix scheduled automations so overdue runs catch up reliably after server downtime. Startup/settings sync no longer pushes unchanged overdue schedules into the future, and memory dreams automation is now synchronized during engine startup before cron begins ticking.
- 26f9c74: Synchronize Fusion skill documentation from `extension.ts` across `SKILL.md`, `references/extension-tools.md`, and `references/fusion-capabilities.md`, and document engine session-scoped runtime tools in a new `references/engine-tools.md` reference.

## Unreleased

### Patch Changes

- FN-2501: Agent pause/resume controls now act immediately. Pausing stops an active heartbeat run right away, and resuming to `active` triggers an immediate on-demand heartbeat instead of waiting for the next timer tick.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- adbad8a: Add `fn plugin add` as a backward-compatible alias for `fn plugin install`, and update plugin command help text to advertise the alias while keeping `install` as the canonical command.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- dbc9446: Add a blocking dashboard token-recovery dialog that appears only for daemon bearer-token 401 responses, with set-token or clear-token recovery actions that reload the app.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 69f789f: TUI: layered defenses for the resize / wrong-height-layout bug

  Materially reduces (but doesn't fully eliminate) the symptom of the header rendering off-screen or the layout taking 1-2 too many rows, especially under tmux/ssh.

  - Enter alternate-screen buffer on start; leave on stop. The TUI gets a dedicated fullscreen surface that doesn't share scrollback.
  - StatusBar Text children no longer wrap (default `wrap="wrap"` was letting long hotkey + URL strings wrap to 2 rows, throwing the row budget off by 1).
  - Controller subscribes to `process.stdout` "resize" and calls `inkInstance.clear()` to reset log-update's frame tracking.
  - App-level resize listener + key-based remount on dimension change so React rebuilds the tree from scratch with fresh bounds.
  - Root Box gets explicit width + overflow="hidden"; MainHeader outer Box too.
  - Settings + Utilities side-by-side now stretch to equal heights (UtilitiesPanel switched from `flexShrink={0}` to `flexGrow={1}`).

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 88b4ecb: TUI fixes: help overlay no longer crashes, header stays rendered

  - Help overlay (`?` / `h`) crashed with "Encountered two children with the same key" because several shortcut entries share the same display key (`[t]` for Git view AND for Toggle engine pause; `[r]` for Refresh stats AND Refresh agent detail). Switch to index-based keys — each row is unique by position, not by character.
  - Refresh the help text to reflect the unified header (`[m]` Main, `[b/a/g/t/e]` views), the Settings/Files/Agents `←/→` pane swap, the Git push/fetch shortcuts, the Files hidden-files toggle, and the Logs `G` jump-to-end.
  - Main view (status mode) header sometimes vanished after a tmux pane switch and stayed missing until a terminal resize. Two fixes: (a) drop the `rows < 10` auto-hide in `MainHeader` — tmux pane switches can briefly report stale or zero dimensions, and a transient `return null` was orphaning the header. (b) Wrap `MainHeader` and `StatusBar` in `flexShrink={0}` boxes inside `StatusModeGrid` and `StatusModeSingle` (matching the prior fix in `InteractiveMode`), so Yoga can't squeeze them to 0 rows when content pressures the row budget.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 0f070d8: TUI header redesign and Settings ←/→ pane navigation

  - Replace the dual section + interactive tab strips with a single unified strip: `[m] Main  [b] Board  [a] Agents  [g] Settings  [t] Git  [e] Explorer`. Status mode highlights the Main pill; interactive views highlight their own. Number-key shortcuts (1–5) for status sections still work but are no longer rendered in the header chrome.
  - Width tiers now fit comfortably at every terminal size: full labels at cols ≥ 90, glyph-only at 50–89 (every shortcut still visible), FUSION + active pill only below 50. Help/quit shows at cols ≥ 110.
  - New `m` shortcut switches to status mode (Main); `s` kept as alias.
  - Settings interactive view: `←` focuses the list pane, `→` focuses the detail pane. `Tab` still cycles either way (consistent with Agents view).

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 58688fa: Keep the FUSION header from wrapping when the terminal is narrow. The `MiniLogo` and tab pills had Yoga's default `flexShrink: 1`, so the row's collective content overrunning the width was being absorbed by shrinking every child — including FUSION, which then wrapped to two lines. Pin all fixed-content header children to `flexShrink={0}`; the trailing flexGrow filler absorbs slack instead.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 07d7bac: Add a blocking dashboard token-recovery dialog that appears only for daemon bearer-token 401 responses, with set-token or clear-token recovery actions that reload the app.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a8f5591: Add support for an optional custom ntfy server URL in notification settings, with default fallback to `https://ntfy.sh` when unset.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- c105cfa: Automatically install the bundled Fusion skill into supported agent home directories during `fn init` (`~/.claude/skills/fusion`, `~/.codex/skills/fusion`, and `~/.gemini/skills/fusion`) when missing. Existing installs are preserved, and per-target filesystem errors now warn without failing project initialization.
- 86521e2: Fix `pnpm install -g @runfusion/fusion` failing with a 404 for `@fusion/pi-claude-cli`. The vendored pi extension is now bundled into the published package's `dist/pi-claude-cli/` and is no longer listed as an external dependency.
- 76961d4: Add a severity filter to the interactive `fn dashboard` TUI Logs tab. Users can now press `f` to cycle `all → info → warn → error` for view-only filtering while preserving the full in-memory ring buffer.
- f77dd9d: Prevent stale dashboard service workers from trapping old client bundles, and compute automation cron schedules against UTC so monthly runs stay on day 1 across timezones.
- f4d2a4b: Fix `fn dashboard` Logs tab row budgeting so log lines stay above the footer hint on short terminals, including wrapped-message cases.
- f77dd9d: Fix dashboard SSE cleanup on browser refresh so stale event streams do not exhaust per-origin browser connections.
- 31f021a: Fix dashboard TUI log severity rendering so structured `logger.log(...)` entries routed via `stderr` display with info severity/icon instead of being misclassified as errors.
- eef56af: Normalize Fusion skill-facing tool naming to the public `fn_*` namespace and clarify the boundary between extension tools and internal engine runtime tools across skill docs.
- 832c32c: Refresh the shipped Fusion skill documentation to match the current `fn_*` extension and CLI surfaces, and replace stale kb-era task/storage examples with Fusion-native `FN-*` and `.fusion` conventions.
- dce70bf: Persist `fn dashboard` bearer tokens in the existing global settings store (`~/.fusion/settings.json`) on first authenticated run, then reuse them on subsequent starts. Explicit overrides (`--token`, `FUSION_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`, `FUSION_DAEMON_TOKEN`) and `--no-auth` precedence remain intact.
- f078a4e: Add a Settings → Pi Extensions action to reinstall Fusion's bundled Pi package (`npm:@runfusion/fusion`) for self-serve recovery when local Pi skill installs are stale or broken.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 9bf2981: Add a `planning-awaiting-input` ntfy notification event so users can opt in to alerts when planning sessions pause for user input.
- Fix the CLI init command import path for the Claude skills runner so tsup can resolve it during build.
- 94473c8: Improve dashboard shutdown observability by logging non-fatal diagnostics when `CentralCore.close()` fails during dispose, normal signal shutdown, or dev-mode shutdown cleanup.
- Fix dashboard and serve command plugin store initialization to support task store implementations that expose `getFusionDir()` without `getRootDir()`.
- c01892d: Route dashboard runtime diagnostics through the shared injected runtime logger so TTY sessions can capture server/package logs in the TUI while preserving readable non-TTY startup banner output.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 39f7709: Dashboard TUI now surfaces engine log output in the Logs tab. Previously, the engine's `createLogger()` writes (scheduler, executor, triage, merger, PR monitor, heartbeat, etc.) went straight to `console.error` and were rendered beneath the alt-screen TUI — effectively invisible. `DashboardLogSink.captureConsole()` now intercepts `console.log/warn/error` while the TUI is running and routes each line into the ring buffer, parsing a leading `[prefix]` tag so entries carry the subsystem prefix. Originals are restored on TUI shutdown.
- 585e480: Add keyboard navigation and inspection features to the Dashboard TUI Logs tab: arrow keys and j/k to navigate entries, Enter to expand selected entry, Esc to close expanded view, and w to toggle wrap mode for long messages.
- 86fd24e: `fn dashboard` TTY mode now opens on the System tab first so users immediately see host, port, URL, and auth token access details.
- 585e480: Fix dashboard TUI log navigation: add Home/End shortcuts for jumping to first/last log entry, add Space and e keys as alternatives to Enter for expanding logs, improve word wrap to handle long unbroken tokens (URLs, stack traces) by hard-wrapping them at terminal width.
- 7d31b21: Fix iOS terminal typing in the dashboard. On touch-primary devices, tapping the terminal opened the on-screen keyboard but keystrokes were silently dropped because the bubble-phase `handleTerminalGestureFocus` handler re-focused the helper textarea and reset its selection during touchstart/pointerdown, disrupting iOS's input-event attribution. The CSS fix in commit c7266b7f already positions the textarea to receive taps natively, so the JS handler is now a no-op on `(hover: none) and (pointer: coarse)` devices and desktop retains click-to-focus.
- Fix dashboard TUI log viewport row calculation on very small terminals to prevent log lines from overlapping the footer.
- ff5df16: Fix executor model resolution precedence so project `defaultProviderOverride`/`defaultModelIdOverride` is honored before falling back to global `defaultProvider`/`defaultModelId` across execute, hot-swap, and step-session paths.
- df2836c: Fix dashboard TUI log behavior so log navigation can reach all entries still present in the ring buffer and streamed merge output is buffered into log lines instead of writing raw fragments into the interactive terminal UI.
- bbdd11a: Guard SQLite FTS5 usage so Fusion starts cleanly on Node builds whose bundled `node:sqlite` was compiled without FTS5. On affected systems, `fn dashboard` previously crashed on first run with `Error: no such module: fts5` during schema migration. The Database and ArchiveDatabase now probe for FTS5 at startup and skip the virtual table + triggers when unavailable; `TaskStore.searchTasks` and `ArchiveDatabase.search` fall back to LIKE-based scans. Set `FUSION_DISABLE_FTS5=1` to force the fallback on runtimes where FTS5 is present but undesirable.
- 0bb0100: Update dashboard TUI header branding from "fn board" to "fusion" for consistent product naming.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 25d44e1: Add interactive TUI to `fn dashboard` with five navigable sections: logs, system, utilities, stats, and settings. Keyboard shortcuts enable quick in-terminal navigation (1-5, arrows, q, Ctrl+C, ? for help). The TUI activates automatically in interactive terminal sessions; non-TTY mode (CI, piped output) retains the existing plain-text banner/log behavior.

### Patch Changes

- a2ed6d0: Fixes for stuck merges and agent lifecycle controls.

  - `findLandedTaskCommit` now falls back to scanning all of `HEAD` when the bounded `baseCommitSha..HEAD` range returns no commits (e.g. baseCommitSha was advanced past the landed merge by a fast-forward rebase). Previously the recovery silently returned null and re-queued the merge even though the commit had already landed.
  - Agent heartbeat triggers and registration are gated by `runtimeConfig.enabled` rather than transient agent state, so paused/idle/error agents stay registered for triggers and re-arm immediately on resume without waiting for a state transition.
  - `AgentDetailView` exposes a Stop control alongside Pause/Retry for `running` and `error` states so operators can terminate stuck agents without going through the agents list.

## 0.0.6

### Patch Changes

- Re-ship three previously reverted fixes and add pre-merge remote rebase.

  - `--no-auth` flag now correctly suppresses bearer-token auth instead of being silently overridden by a stale `FUSION_DAEMON_TOKEN` in the project's `.env`.
  - Workflow-review revisions reopen only the last step rather than resetting every previously-completed step. The agent applies the feedback as an in-place fix and earlier approved work stays done. New `reopenLastStepForRevision` helper is used by `handleWorkflowRevisionRequest`, `handleWorkflowStepFailure`, and `sendTaskBackForFix`. `determineRevisionResetStart` is marked `@deprecated` and kept exported for tests.
  - Heartbeat scheduling is now driven by `agent.state` (`active`/`running` = timer armed; everything else = timer cleared), not `runtimeConfig.enabled`. Resuming a paused agent through the dashboard now re-arms the timer immediately.
  - New setting `worktreeRebaseBeforeMerge` (default `true`) and companion `worktreeRebaseRemote` (default: git's configured default). The merger fetches the remote and rebases the task branch onto the latest default-branch tip before merging; conflicts flow into the existing smart/AI resolve cascade. Dashboard Settings → Worktrees exposes a checkbox and a remote dropdown populated from `/api/git/remotes/detailed`.
  - Last/Next heartbeat labels on the agent list card now share font-size and inline-flex alignment so they line up cleanly.

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 41553a5: Harden agent lifecycle around closed tasks and heartbeat defaults.

  - `HeartbeatMonitor.executeHeartbeat()` now exits before session creation when the resolved task is done/archived (reason `task_closed`) and clears the stale `agent.taskId` linkage so the guard isn't re-tripped on every tick.
  - `HeartbeatTriggerScheduler.watchAssignments()` skips callback dispatch when the assigned task is already closed (when a `taskStore` is wired in).
  - `POST /api/agents/:id/runs` performs the same preflight check and returns 409 with a structured error naming the task id + column, keeping the existing active-run 409 precedence.
  - `AgentStore.createAgent()` now persists `runtimeConfig.heartbeatIntervalMs` (default 1h) on non-ephemeral agents so the dashboard's freshness signal matches the scheduler's effective cadence instead of depending on whether the user ever opened the heartbeat dropdown. Exports a new `DEFAULT_AGENT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` constant.

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 0da498a: Fix dashboard onboarding auth token controls, keep the AI planning modal footer visible on desktop, and add better terminal PTY spawn diagnostics.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 1fc72d1: Improve the dashboard agents list views with shared empty-state actions, token-based state styling, and clearer board/tree/org-chart presentation.
- 46b8032: Make `fn agent import` import package skills alongside agents when importing from directory or archive sources. Skills are written to `{project}/skills/imported/{company-slug}/{skill-slug}/SKILL.md` with proper frontmatter formatting. Existing skill files are skipped rather than overwritten. Single AGENTS.md file imports do not include package skills.
- c1bc5b9: Fix CLI merge regressions in test/build verification: restore gh-cli test alias resolution, ensure daemon ignores invalid env tokens, and restore required changeset config.
- 06704cf: Fix the setup wizard directory browser and make terminal session startup more resilient.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Add `fusion` bin alias so `npx @runfusion/fusion` resolves to the CLI
  (the `fn` command is still available and unchanged).

## 0.0.1

### Initial release

First public release under the `@runfusion` scope. Package was previously
developed under the `@gsxdsm/fusion` name; it was never published to npm,
so version history resets with `0.0.1`. Pre-release notes preserved below
for reference.

---

## 0.4.0 (pre-release, unpublished)

### Minor Changes

- 2d13b82: Add pi extension. Installing `@runfusion/fusion` via `pi install` now provides native tools (`fn_task_create`, `fn_task_list`, `fn_task_show`, `fn_task_attach`, `fn_task_pause`, `fn_task_unpause`) and a `/fn` command to start the dashboard and AI engine from within a pi session.
- 494de14: Changed `autoMerge` to default to `true` for new boards.
- 50821fc: Add global pause button to stop all automated agents and scheduling
- cac10af: Split engine control into Pause (soft) and Stop (hard). The dashboard Header now shows two buttons: "Pause AI engine" stops new work from being dispatched while letting in-flight agents finish gracefully, and "Stop AI engine" (previously the only Pause button) immediately kills all active agent sessions. A new `enginePaused` setting field controls the soft-pause state alongside the existing `globalPause` hard-stop.

### Patch Changes

- d19b51f: Auto-assign random port when dashboard port is already in use instead of crashing with EADDRINUSE.
- ceb379d: Engine pause now terminates active agent sessions (matching global pause behavior) instead of letting them finish gracefully. Tasks are moved back to todo/cleared for clean resume on unpause.
- acb246a: Fix active agent glow disappearing when scheduling is soft-paused
- 43aada5: Fix scheduler to not count in-review worktrees against maxWorktrees limit. In-review tasks are idle (waiting to merge) and no longer block new tasks from starting.
- 9033a79: Fix InlineCreateCard cancelling when clicking dependency dropdown items with empty description.
- 96f1070: Fix double horizontal scrollbar on mobile board view by switching the board from a 5-column grid to a flex layout on narrow viewports (≤768px) with snap-scrolling.
- 3dc741c: Fix auto-pause on rate limit when pi-coding-agent exhausts retries. After `session.prompt()` resolves with exhausted retries, all four agent types (executor, triage, merger, reviewer) now detect the error on `session.state.error` and trigger `UsageLimitPauser` to activate global pause. Previously, rate-limit errors that pi-coding-agent handled internally were silently swallowed, causing tasks to be promoted to wrong columns with incomplete work.
- 2854553: Fix triage allowing tasks to reach executor before spec review approval
- 72a8953: Fix specifying agents not respecting maxConcurrent concurrency limit
- a2a12f9: Persist worktree pool across engine restarts. When `recycleWorktrees` is enabled, idle worktrees are rehydrated from disk on startup instead of being forgotten. When disabled, orphaned worktrees are cleaned up automatically.
- 65b9585: Add priority-based agent scheduling: merge agents are served before execution agents, which are served before specification agents, when competing for concurrency slots.
- 98ed082: Restructure README to lead with pi extension usage; move standalone CLI docs to STANDALONE.md.
- 2d13b82: Agents now declare dependencies when creating multiple related tasks during execution
- 0e0643a: Skip merger agent when squash merge stages nothing (branch already merged via dependency)
- d2e2e50: Make "Pause AI engine" a soft pause: only prevents new agents from starting while allowing currently running agents to finish their work naturally. "Stop AI engine" (global pause) still immediately terminates all active agents.
- 90764b9: Auto-pause engine when API usage limits are detected (rate limits, overloaded, quota exceeded). Prevents wasteful retries across concurrent agents.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- ae90be0: Bundle workspace packages into CLI for npm publish. The published package previously declared dependencies on private `@kb/core`, `@kb/dashboard`, and `@kb/engine` workspace packages, causing `npm install` to fail. Switched the CLI build from `tsc` to `tsup` (esbuild) to inline all `@kb/*` workspace code into a single bundled `dist/bin.js`, while keeping third-party packages (`express`, `multer`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`) as external dependencies. Dashboard client assets are now copied into `dist/client/` so the published tarball is fully self-contained.
- 28bbcb9: Exclude Bun-compiled platform binaries from npm publish tarball, reducing package size significantly.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fc7582d: Expand agent.log logging to all agent types, additionally capturing thinking, and agent roles
- cc999ef: RETHINK verdicts trigger git reset and conversation rewind, re-prompting the agent with feedback

### Patch Changes

- f3c7f7d: CLI `task create` now supports a `--depends <id>` flag (repeatable) to declare task dependencies at creation time.
- fc7582d: Code review REVISE verdicts are now enforced such that agents can no longer advance steps without APPROVE
- cc999ef: Plan RETHINK triggers conversation rewind with REVISE enforcement on code reviews
- cc999ef: Dependent tasks can start from in-review dependency branches instead of waiting for merge

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- efdb7de: Clean up README: plain ASCII file tree, mermaid workflow diagram with column descriptions, update quick start to use `kb` CLI, add authentication section to CLI README, document cross-model review in executor description.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b12d340: Add automated versioning pipeline using changesets. Developers now add changeset files to describe changes, and a CI workflow automatically opens version PRs that bump versions and generate changelogs.
