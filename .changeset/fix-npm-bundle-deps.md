"@runfusion/fusion": patch

Verify and tighten npm bundle fixes from FN-2897: keep the vendored pi-claude-cli runtime on Node built-in child_process APIs (no cross-spawn dependency), confirm Claude CLI extension resolution works from the published dist/pi-claude-cli layout, and ensure prepack strips private @fusion/* workspace devDependencies from the published package manifest.
