# Fusion

AI-orchestrated task board — specify, execute, and deliver tasks automatically.

Like Trello, but your tasks get specified, executed, and delivered by AI — powered by [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).

![Fusion dashboard](demo/screenshot.png)

**Fusion** turns rough ideas into production code. Describe a task, and an AI agent writes the spec, plans the implementation, writes the code in an isolated git worktree, and merges it — with automatic code review at every step. Manage a single project or coordinate across multiple repositories from one dashboard.

## Quick Start

1. **Install:**
   ```bash
   npm i -g @gsxdsm/fusion
   ```

2. **Initialize (or just start the dashboard):**
   ```bash
   fn dashboard
   ```

3. **Open** [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040) — create tasks from the board or the CLI.

**First-run setup:** On first launch, Fusion opens a guided onboarding modal that walks you through configuring provider credentials (OAuth login or API key entry) and selecting a default AI model. Completion is tracked via the `modelOnboardingComplete` global setting. You can re-trigger onboarding at any time by clearing this flag in Settings, or configure providers and models manually from the Settings modal.

### Prerequisites

The AI engine uses [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) under the hood:

1. `npm i -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`
2. Run `pi` and use `/login`, or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

Fusion reuses your existing pi authentication.

```

Tasks with dependencies are processed sequentially. Independent tasks run in parallel.

In **Triage**, an AI agent reads your project, understands context, and writes a full `PROMPT.md` specification — steps, file scope, acceptance criteria. Optionally require manual approval before tasks move to **Todo** (`requirePlanApproval` setting).

## Core Features

### Task Creation

Create tasks from the CLI, the dashboard, or import from GitHub:

```bash
fn task create "Fix the login bug"                     # Quick entry → triage
fn task create "Bug" --attach screenshot.png --depends FN-001
fn task plan "Build a user authentication system"      # AI-guided planning
fn task import owner/repo --labels bug --limit 10      # Import GitHub issues
```

**Dashboard creation options:**
- **Quick Entry** — Type a description, press Enter
- **Plan** (💡) — AI interviews you to refine requirements before creating the task
- **Subtask** (🌳) — AI suggests 2–5 subtasks with drag-and-drop reordering and dependency linking
- **Actions** (⋯) — Access advanced controls: dependencies, model overrides (executor/validator/planning), and manual save
- **AI Title Summarization** — When `autoSummarizeTitles` is enabled, tasks without titles get concise AI-generated names (≤60 characters)

### AI Execution

Each task is implemented by an AI agent with a full Plan → Review → Execute → Review cycle:

1. **Automatic spec writing** — The triage agent generates a detailed `PROMPT.md` with steps, file scope, and acceptance criteria
2. **Step-by-step execution** — For each step: plan, AI code review, implement, AI code review
3. **Git worktree isolation** — Each task runs in its own worktree (`fusion/{task-id}` branch)
4. **Workflow steps** — Configurable quality gates (pre-merge: blocks merge; post-merge: informational)

```bash
fn task show FN-001                    # View task details, steps, log
fn task logs FN-001 --follow --limit 50  # Stream agent execution logs
fn task steer FN-001 "Use TypeScript"  # Guide the AI worker mid-execution
```

### Dashboard

Real-time kanban board at `localhost:4040`:

- **Board view** — Drag-and-drop cards between columns, real-time search, column visibility toggle
- **List view** — Group by column or size, inline title editing, duplicate tasks
- **Interactive terminal** — Full PTY-based terminal with xterm.js, multiple tabs, mobile-aware with virtual keyboard handling that keeps the entry area visible above the on-screen keyboard on real devices (Chrome Android and iOS Safari)
- **Git manager** — View commits/diffs, manage branches, worktree associations, push/pull, inline edit controls for remote name and URL
- **Activity log** — Task lifecycle events, settings changes, filter by type, auto-refresh
- **Files browser** — Browse project root or task worktrees, edit files with syntax highlighting
- **Theme system** — Dark/Light/System modes, 17 color themes (Ocean, Forest, Nord, Dracula, and more)
- **Usage dialog** — Real-time AI provider subscription usage with progress bars and reset timers
- **Spec editor** — Edit `PROMPT.md` directly or request AI revision from the dashboard

### GitHub Integration

```bash
fn task import owner/repo                  # Import all open issues
fn task import owner/repo --interactive    # Interactive issue selection
fn task pr-create FN-001 --title "Fix" --base main
```

- **Real-time PR/issue badges** — Live status updates via WebSocket
- **PR creation** — Create PRs from the CLI or dashboard, linked to tasks automatically
- **PR comment monitoring** — Adaptive polling detects actionable review feedback, adds steering comments
- **Auto-completion modes** — Direct squash merge (default) or PR-first with auto-merge when checks pass
- **Follow-up tasks** — When a PR is closed/merged with unaddressed feedback, a follow-up task is created in Triage

### Merge & Review

When a task reaches **In Review**, Fusion handles merge with rich metadata:

- Merge commit SHA, files changed, insertions/deletions, timestamps
- Smart conflict resolution: lock files ("ours"), generated files ("theirs"), whitespace conflicts
- 3-attempt retry logic with escalating strategies (AI resolve → auto-resolve patterns → `git merge -X theirs`)
- **Changes tab** — View file-level diffs from the merge commit, even after worktree cleanup. Done tasks without a recorded commit SHA show a safe summary fallback instead of inflated repository-wide diffs.

## Multi-Project Support

Fusion supports managing multiple projects from a single installation. Register projects, switch between them with a global `--project` flag, and monitor all activity from a unified dashboard.

### Project Management

```bash
fn project add my-app /path/to/app       # Register a project
fn project list                           # List all projects
fn project show my-app                    # Show project details and health
fn project set-default my-app             # Set default project
fn project detect                         # Detect project from current directory
fn project remove my-app [--force]        # Unregister a project
```

### The `--project` Flag

All task commands accept `--project` (or `-P`) to target a specific project:

```bash
fn task create "Fix login bug" --project my-app
fn task list --project my-app
fn task show FN-001 --project my-app
fn settings set maxConcurrent 4 --project my-app
fn git status --project my-app
fn backup --create --project my-app
```

### Project Resolution

When you run a command without `--project`, Fusion resolves the project in this order:
1. Explicit `--project` flag
2. Default project (set via `fn project set-default`)
3. CWD auto-detection (walks up looking for `.fusion/fusion.db`)

### Architecture

- **Central database** at `~/.pi/fusion/fusion-central.db` — project registry, unified activity feed, global concurrency
- **Per-project databases** at `.fusion/fusion.db` — SQLite with WAL mode for concurrent access
- **Global concurrency management** — System-wide agent slot limits across projects
- **Isolation modes** — `in-process` (default, low overhead) or `child-process` (strong isolation with crash containment)

Auto-migration is seamless: existing single-project users are automatically migrated on first run. Rollback is safe — delete the central database and per-project data remains intact.

## Task Management

### Commands

**Dashboard:**
```bash
fn dashboard                              # Start the web UI (default port 4040)

fn task pause FN-001                     # Pause automation for task
fn task unpause FN-001                   # Resume automation for task
```

**Mission Management:**
```bash
fn mission create "Title" "Description"    # Create a new mission
fn mission list                             # List all missions
fn mission show <id>                        # Show mission with hierarchy

fn mission activate-slice <slice-id>        # Manually activate a pending slice
```

**Git Commands:**
```bash
fn git status                             # Show branch, commit, dirty state
fn git fetch [remote]                     # Fetch from remote
fn git pull [--yes]                       # Pull current branch
fn git push [--yes]                       # Push current branch
```

**Settings:**
```bash
fn settings                               # Show current configuration
fn settings set maxConcurrent 4          # Update a setting
fn settings export --scope both           # Export settings to JSON
fn settings import fusion-settings.json --yes  # Import settings
```

**Backup & Restore:**
```bash
fn backup --create                         # Create a database backup immediately
fn backup --list                           # List all backups with sizes
fn backup --restore backup-file.db        # Restore database from backup
fn backup --cleanup                        # Remove old backups exceeding retention
```

### Task Comments vs Steering Comments

Fusion supports two distinct kinds of discussion on a task:

- **Task comments** — General collaboration notes for humans. Add from the dashboard or CLI with `fn task comment <id> "message"`.
- **Steering comments** — Execution guidance aimed at the AI worker. Use for actionable direction like "change this approach." Also populated automatically from actionable PR review feedback.

### Refinement Tasks

`fn task refine` creates a follow-up task in Triage that depends on the original. The title follows the format `Refinement: {source label}` for easy identification.

### Archive

Completed tasks can be archived to keep the board focused:

```bash
fn task archive FN-001        # Archive a done task
fn task unarchive FN-001      # Restore an archived task to done
```

Archive cleanup removes task directories while preserving compact metadata in `.fusion/archive.jsonl`. Restored tasks keep all metadata but lose attachments and agent logs. Archived tasks appear in a collapsed "Archived" column in the dashboard.

## Model System

Fusion provides flexible AI model configuration with support for model presets, per-task overrides, and a hierarchical settings system.

### Model Presets

Model presets let teams standardize AI model choices. Each preset contains:
- **ID** — stable slug for storage (e.g., `budget`, `normal`, `complex`)
- **Name** — human-friendly label
- **Executor model** — provider/model pair for task execution
- **Validator model** — provider/model pair for code/spec review

Presets can be auto-selected by task size:
- **Small (S)** → Budget preset
- **Medium (M)** → Normal preset
- **Large (L)** → Complex preset

### Per-Task Model Overrides

Override global models for specific tasks:
- **Executor Model** — AI model that implements the task
- **Validator Model** — AI model that reviews code and plans

Set overrides in the dashboard via **task detail → Model tab**, or choose **Custom** during task creation.

### Settings Hierarchy

**Global settings** (`~/.pi/fusion/settings.json`):
- `defaultProvider` / `defaultModelId` — Default AI models
- `planningProvider` / `planningModelId` — Task specification models
- `validatorProvider` / `validatorModelId` — Review models
- `themeMode`, `colorTheme` — UI preferences
- `ntfyEnabled`, `ntfyTopic` — Push notifications

**Project settings** (`.fusion/config.json`):
- `modelPresets` — Custom preset definitions
- `autoSelectPresetBySize` — Size-to-preset mappings
- All workflow and automation settings

Project settings override global settings. Configure in the dashboard under **Settings > Model**.

### Agent Log Model Display

The dashboard Agent Log subview shows which AI models were used for each task (Executor, Validator, Planning/Triage). When no model can be resolved, the header shows "Using default".

## Missions

The Missions system provides a hierarchical planning structure for large-scale projects:

```
Mission ("Build Auth System")
├── Milestone 1: "Database Schema"
│   ├── Slice 1: "User Tables"
│   │   ├── Feature 1: "User model" → Task FN-101
│   │   └── Feature 2: "Session table" → Task FN-102
│   └── Slice 2: "Token Storage"
│       └── Feature 3: "Refresh tokens" → Task FN-103
├── Milestone 2: "API Endpoints"
│   └── Slice 3: "Login/Logout"
│       ├── Feature 4: "Login endpoint" → Task FN-104
│       └── Feature 5: "Logout endpoint" → Task FN-105
└── Milestone 3: "UI Integration"
    └── Slice 4: "React Components"
        └── Feature 6: "Login form" → Task FN-106
```

**Hierarchy:** Mission → Milestone → Slice → Feature → Task

Status flows automatically: when features are linked to tasks and completed, slice status updates. When all slices in a milestone are complete, the milestone becomes complete. When all milestones are done, the mission is complete.

## Workflow Steps

Workflow steps are reusable quality gates that run at configurable lifecycle phases. Each step can run as **prompt** (AI agent review) or **script** (deterministic command), and at **pre-merge** (blocks merge) or **post-merge** (informational) phase.

### Execution Phases

| Phase | When it runs | Failure behavior |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Pre-merge** (default) | After task implementation, before in-review | Blocks merge — task stays in in-review |
| **Post-merge** | After successful merge to main | Logged only — does not block or rollback |

### Execution Modes

| Mode | How it works | Use for |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Prompt** | Read-only AI agent reviews changes | Code review, security audits, documentation checks |
| **Script** | Runs a named script from `settings.scripts` | Test suites, linting, type checking |

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "pnpm test",
    "lint": "pnpm lint",
    "typecheck": "pnpm tsc --noEmit"
  }
}
```

Prompt-mode steps support **model overrides** — pin a specific AI model per quality gate. Script-mode steps run with a 2-minute timeout.

### Built-in Templates

| Template | Category | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Documentation Review** | Quality | Verify all public APIs have documentation |
| **QA Check** | Quality | Run tests, check for bugs |
| **Security Audit** | Security | Check for vulnerabilities and anti-patterns |
| **Performance Review** | Quality | Check for performance anti-patterns |
| **Accessibility Check** | Quality | Verify WCAG 2.1 compliance |

Click **Add** on any template in the Workflow Step Manager to create a customizable step.

### Default On for New Tasks

Workflow steps can be marked as **"Default on for new tasks"** in the Workflow Step Manager. When enabled:

- The step is automatically pre-selected in the task creation form
- A gold "Default on" badge appears on the step card in the manager
- Users can still deselect the step — this only controls the initial default state

**Behavior during task creation:**

| Scenario | What happens |
|----------|-------------|
| User creates task, doesn't modify workflow steps | Auto-selected defaults are applied; backend sends the selected steps |
| User deselects all auto-selected steps | Empty array is sent to backend — no workflow steps run |
| User adds additional steps | All selected steps (auto + manual) are included |
| User re-opens task creation modal | Defaults are re-applied for the new session |

Edit mode never auto-injects workflow steps — existing task selections are preserved.

### Using Workflow Steps

1. When creating or editing a task, check the workflow steps you want
2. Reorder with ▲/▼ buttons when two or more are selected
3. Pre-merge steps must all pass before the task moves to in-review
4. Post-merge steps run automatically after merge — results appear in the Workflow tab
5. View results in the task detail modal's **Workflow** tab

## Architecture

### Storage

Fusion uses a hybrid storage architecture: structured metadata in **SQLite** with WAL mode for concurrent access, and large files (specs, logs, attachments) on the filesystem.

```
.fusion/
├── fusion.db                # SQLite database (tasks, config, activity log, agents)
├── config.json              # Project config + settings (synced to SQLite)
└── tasks/
    └── FN-001/
        ├── task.json.bak    # Legacy backup (after migration)
        ├── PROMPT.md        # Task specification
        └── attachments/     # File attachments
```

### AI Engine

The AI engine starts automatically with the dashboard. Three components run:

- **TriageProcessor** — Watches triage column. Spawns an AI agent that reads the project, understands context, and writes a full `PROMPT.md` specification. When the reviewer flags a task as oversized (8+ steps, 3+ packages, multiple independent deliverables), the triage agent proactively splits it into 2–5 child tasks using `task_create` and closes the parent. Moves approved single tasks to todo.

- **Scheduler** — Watches todo column. Resolves dependency graphs. Moves tasks to in-progress when deps are satisfied and concurrency allows (default: 2 concurrent). When `groupOverlappingFiles` is enabled, tasks whose file scopes overlap are serialized to prevent merge conflicts.

- **TaskExecutor** — Listens for tasks entering in-progress. Creates a git worktree, spawns an AI agent with full coding tools scoped to the worktree, and executes the specification. If the task has enabled pre-merge workflow steps, runs them sequentially before moving to in-review.

Each AI agent session gets:
- Custom system prompt for its role
- Tools scoped to the correct directory
- In-memory sessions with auto-compaction for long conversations
- Your existing pi auth (API keys from `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`)

### Error Recovery

The engine automatically recovers from transient failures using bounded exponential backoff:

- **Recoverable failures** — Transient errors trigger retry with increasing delay (60s → 120s → 240s, capped at 5 minutes). Up to 3 retries before permanent failure.
- **Stale worktree/branch references** — Automatic pruning, branch deletion, and force-ref cleanup.
- **Stuck task detection** — When `taskStuckTimeoutMs` is set, tasks with no agent activity are terminated and re-queued. Detects both dead sessions (no heartbeats) and loops (active but no step progress). Loop recovery attempts compact-and-resume before kill/requeue.
- **Context-limit recovery** — When an LLM returns context-window overflow, the executor compacts the session and resumes with a fresh prompt.

## Packages

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@fusion/core` | Domain model — tasks, board columns, SQLite store |
| `@fusion/dashboard` | Web UI — Express server + kanban board with SSE |
| `@fusion/engine` | AI engine — triage, execution, scheduling, workflow steps |
| `@fusion/tui` | Terminal UI — Ink-based CLI components |

## Configuration Reference

Fusion uses a two-tier settings hierarchy:
- **Global settings** (`~/.pi/fusion/settings.json`) — User preferences across all projects
- **Project settings** (`.fusion/config.json`) — Project-specific workflow settings

Project settings override global settings. Configure in the dashboard under **Settings**.

### Key Settings Explained

**Smart Conflict Resolution:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "smartConflictResolution": true
  }
}
```
Automatically resolves lock files ("ours"), generated files ("theirs"), and trivial whitespace conflicts during merge.

**Stuck Task Detection:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "taskStuckTimeoutMs": 600000
  }
}
```
Terminates and retries tasks with no agent activity for 10 minutes. Detects dead sessions and loops separately, with compact-and-resume recovery for loops.

**Push Notifications:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "ntfyEnabled": true,
    "ntfyTopic": "my-kb-notifications"
  }
}
```
Get notified when tasks complete, merge, or fail. Includes dashboard deep links when `ntfyDashboardHost` is set.

**Plan Approval:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "requirePlanApproval": true
  }
}
```
AI-generated specifications require manual approval before moving to Todo. Tasks show "Awaiting Approval" status with amber highlighting.

**Comment-Aware Triage & Spec Review:**

User comments on triage tasks are automatically consumed during specification generation and spec review:

- **During triage**: The AI triage agent sees all user comments as explicit feedback context, ensuring the specification addresses every user concern.
- **During spec review**: The reviewer explicitly verifies that every user comment is addressed in the PROMPT.md. Missing comment coverage results in a `REVISE` verdict.
- **Stale approval invalidation**: If a new user comment arrives after the spec was approved, the approval is automatically invalidated. The task returns to triage with `needs-respecify` status, triggering re-specification and re-review before the task can advance to execution. This prevents stale specs from reaching the execution phase when users provide late feedback.

**Auto-Backup:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "autoBackupEnabled": true,
    "autoBackupSchedule": "0 2 * * *",
    "autoBackupRetention": 7
  }
}
```
Automatic SQLite database backups with configurable schedule, retention, and directory.

**Worktree Naming & Recycling:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "worktreeNaming": "task-id",
    "recycleWorktrees": true
  }
}
```
- `worktreeNaming`: Control directory names — `random` (human-friendly like `swift-falcon`), `task-id` (e.g., `fn-042`), or `task-title` (slugified title)
- `recycleWorktrees`: Pool and reuse worktree directories for efficiency instead of creating new ones per task

## Scheduled Tasks

Automate recurring workflows with multi-step scheduled tasks:

| Preset | Cron | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `every15Minutes` | `*/15 * * * *` | Every 15 minutes |
| `hourly` | `0 * * * *` | Every hour |
| `daily` | `0 0 * * *` | Daily at midnight |
| `weekdays` | `0 0 * * 1-5` | Weekdays at midnight |
| `weekly` | `0 0 * * 0` | Weekly on Sunday |

Each schedule contains multiple steps executed sequentially. Steps can be commands (with timeout and `continueOnFailure` options) or AI prompts. Access via the **Scheduled Tasks** button in the dashboard header.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev:ui                     # Dashboard only; builds and typechecks first
pnpm dev dashboard              # Board + AI engine
pnpm dev task list              # CLI commands
pnpm typecheck                  # Type-check all packages (no build required)
pnpm test                       # Run all tests
```

### Building a Standalone Executable

Build a single self-contained `fn` binary using [Bun](https://bun.sh/):

```bash
pnpm build:exe                  # Build for current platform
pnpm build:exe:all              # Cross-compile for all platforms
```

| Target | Output |
|--------|--------|
| `bun-linux-x64` | `fusion-linux-x64` |
| `bun-linux-arm64` | `fusion-linux-arm64` |
| `bun-darwin-x64` | `fusion-darwin-x64` |
| `bun-darwin-arm64` | `fusion-darwin-arm64` |
| `bun-windows-x64` | `fusion-windows-x64.exe` |

Override the dashboard asset path via `FUSION_CLIENT_DIR` environment variable. Prerequisites: Bun ≥ 1.0.

## Releases

Packages are published to npm automatically via GitHub Actions and [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

```bash
npm install -g @gsxdsm/fusion
```

See [RELEASING.md](./RELEASING.md) for the full workflow. In short: add a changeset with `pnpm changeset`, merge to main, then merge the auto-generated "Version Packages" PR.
