/**
 * Transient Error Detector — classifies network/infrastructure errors as transient
 * (temporary and retryable) versus permanent failures.
 *
 * Transient errors indicate temporary conditions like network blips, proxy hiccups,
 * connection resets, or temporary service unavailability. These errors typically
 * resolve on their own after a short delay and should NOT mark tasks as failed.
 *
 * When a transient error is detected, the task should be moved back to "todo"
 * for later retry rather than being marked as "failed". This prevents tasks from
 * being incorrectly marked as failed due to temporary infrastructure issues.
 *
 * Contrast with:
 * - Usage limit errors: Systemic conditions (rate limits, quota) → trigger global pause
 * - Permanent errors: Code issues, test failures, logic errors → mark task as failed
