## Your entire dev environment. On a single pane of glass.

Describe a task in plain language. A triage agent reads your project, understands context, and writes a full `PROMPT.md` spec — steps, file scope, acceptance criteria. Then Fusion plans, reviews, executes, and reviews again, in an isolated git worktree, with a human approval gate wherever you want one.

One board. Controlled from anywhere. Laptop, Mac mini, Linux server, cloud VM, phone — all connected.

> Like Trello, but your tasks get specified, executed, and delivered by AI — powered by [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). Built on the great work of [dustinbyrne/kb](https://github.com/dustinbyrne/kb).

## The flow

```
  ①  Describe          ②  Triage             ③  The board           ④  Isolated worktree
  ─────────────        ─────────────         ─────────────          ─────────────────────
  "Add dark mode   →   Agent writes    →   Plan → Review →    →   fusion/FN-123 branch
   toggle to           PROMPT.md           Execute → Review        concurrent, zero
   settings panel"     (steps, scope,      (per step, until        file conflicts
                       acceptance)         done)
```

### See every step, before the merge

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://runfusion.ai/screenshot-task-detail.png" alt="Fusion task detail: workflow steps visible on an in-progress task with diffs and file changes" width="820" />
</div>

Every task shows its plan, its reviews, its diffs, and its file changes in real time. Jump into an active task and nudge direction, tighten constraints, pause, or re-prompt.

## What makes it different

|  |  |
|---|---|
| 🧠 **AI specification** | Describe a task in plain language. Triage agents turn it into a `PROMPT.md` spec with steps, file scope, and acceptance criteria. |
| 🔁 **Workflow gates** | Plan → Review → Execute → Review on every step. Pre-merge gates block bad code; post-merge gates run informational checks. |
| 🌳 **Worktree isolation** | Each task runs in its own branch and worktree (`fusion/{task-id}`). Parallel tasks. Zero conflicts. |
| ⚡ **Smart merge** | Passing every gate? Fusion squash-merges and moves on. Opt into manual approval anywhere. |
| 🛰️ **Multi-node mesh** | Laptop, Mac mini, Linux server, cloud VM, phone — all synced. Desktop, mobile, web. |
| 🧩 **Any model** | Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama — or anything pi-compatible. Local and cloud coexist. |
| 🏢 **Agent companies** | Import pre-built teams — 440+ agents across 16 companies — and run them autonomously for weeks. |
| 📬 **Inter-agent messaging** | Built-in mailbox between agents. Delegate, clarify, coordinate. |
| 🗺️ **Missions** | Hierarchical planning (Mission → Milestone → Slice → Feature → Task) with autopilot and validation contracts. |
| 🧪 **Self-improvement** | Agents reflect on their own output and update their prompts as they learn your codebase. |
| 🔓 **Open source. MIT.** | No vendor lock-in. Run it on your own hardware. Shipping weekly. |

Tasks with dependencies are processed sequentially. Independent tasks run in parallel. Optionally require manual approval before tasks move from Triage to Todo (`requirePlanApproval` setting).

Laptop, Mac mini, Linux server, cloud VM, phone — every node is a peer. Your task state, agents, logs, and diffs stay synchronized across the mesh. The same Fusion ships as:

- 🖥️ **Desktop app** — Electron for **macOS** (Intel + Apple Silicon), **Windows** 10/11, and **Linux**
- 📱 **Mobile app** — Capacitor for **iOS/iPadOS** and **Android** ([MOBILE.md](./MOBILE.md))
- 🌐 **Web dashboard** — any modern browser, served from the `fn dashboard` daemon
- 🔌 **CLI** — `fn` binary + pi extension for terminal-first workflows

Start the daemon on any node, connect your other devices, and the board follows you everywhere.

  ### [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) <sub>`experimental`</sub>

</div>

Fusion runs on top of **pi** — a minimal, hackable coding-agent runtime. Install Fusion as a pi extension and get native tools (`fn_task_create`, `fn_task_list`, `fn_task_show`, …) plus a `/fn` command to start the dashboard straight from a pi session.

```bash
pi install npm:@runfusion/fusion
```

  ### [Hermes](https://github.com/paperclipai) <sub>`experimental`</sub>

</div>

Fusion speaks **Hermes**, the open agent-company protocol from [Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai). Import a prebuilt team from `companies.sh` and let its agents coordinate over Fusion's mailbox, missions, and workflow gates for weeks of autonomous work.

```bash
npx companies.sh add paperclipai/companies/gstack
```

</td>

</table>

> Both integrations are **experimental** — APIs and wire formats may shift between minor releases.

---

## Quick start

Zero-install, straight from npm:

```bash
npx @runfusion/fusion dashboard
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @runfusion/fusion
fn dashboard                # or: fusion dashboard
```

Or from a clone:

```bash
pnpm dev dashboard
```

Then click the `Open:` URL printed in the terminal. It embeds a bearer token
(`http://localhost:4040/?token=fn_...`) that the browser captures to
`localStorage` on first visit and reuses automatically thereafter. See
[CLI reference → fn dashboard → Authentication](./docs/cli-reference.md#fn-dashboard)
for how to pin a stable token via `FUSION_DASHBOARD_TOKEN` or opt out with
`--no-auth`.

### First-run setup

On first launch, Fusion opens the **onboarding wizard** with three guided steps:

1. **AI Setup** — Connect an AI provider and choose a default model
2. **GitHub (Optional)** — Connect GitHub for issue import and PR management
3. **First Task** — Create your first task or import from GitHub

The wizard is **dismissible and non-blocking** — click **Skip for now** to use the dashboard immediately. Re-trigger it later from **Settings → Authentication → Reopen onboarding guide**.

### Mobile

For Capacitor + PWA workflow, see [MOBILE.md](./MOBILE.md).

## Core features

- **AI Specification** — Triage agent generates detailed `PROMPT.md` with steps, file scope, and acceptance criteria
- **Step-by-step Execution** — Plan → Review → Execute → Review cycle for each task step
- **Git Worktree Isolation** — Each task runs in its own worktree (`fusion/{task-id}` branch)
- **Workflow Steps** — Configurable quality gates (pre-merge: blocks merge; post-merge: informational)
- **GitHub Integration** — Import issues, create PRs, real-time PR/issue badges
- **Dashboard** — Real-time kanban board, agent management, terminal, git manager, mission planner
- **Missions** — Hierarchical planning (Mission → Milestone → Slice → Feature → Task) with autopilot, validation contracts, fix-feature retries, and blocked-handoff semantics
- **Multi-Project** — Manage multiple projects from a single installation with project isolation
- **Inter-Agent Messaging** — Built-in messaging for coordination between agents and users

### Provider authentication

Fusion supports OAuth-based authentication for AI providers configured via **Settings → Authentication**. When the dashboard is accessed via a non-localhost host (remote node, LAN host/IP, or reverse proxy), provider login URLs are automatically rewritten to route OAuth callbacks through a bridge endpoint (`/api/auth/openai-codex/callback`), ensuring the redirect reaches the active browser session.

- **OpenAI Codex** — Authenticates via Settings OAuth flow with secure state validation
- **Other providers** — Authenticate via API key entry in Settings
- **pi authentication** — Handled separately via the `pi` CLI (`/login`) or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable

### Model system

Fusion uses a dual-scope model hierarchy with five independent lanes. Global settings define baseline defaults; project settings provide per-project overrides.

| Lane | Purpose | Global Baseline Keys | Project Override Keys |
|------|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Executor | Task execution agent | `executionGlobalProvider` + `executionGlobalModelId` | `executionProvider` + `executionModelId` |
| Planning/Triage | Task specification agent | `planningGlobalProvider` + `planningGlobalModelId` | `planningProvider` + `planningModelId` |
| Validator | Plan/code reviewer | `validatorGlobalProvider` + `validatorGlobalModelId` | `validatorProvider` + `validatorModelId` |
| Title Summarization | Auto-title generation | `titleSummarizerGlobalProvider` + `titleSummarizerGlobalModelId` | `titleSummarizerProvider` + `titleSummarizerModelId` |
| Workflow Step Refinement | AI prompt refinement | (uses `defaultProvider`/`defaultModelId`) | (uses `modelProvider`/`modelId` on WorkflowStep) |

**Per-Task Overrides:** Tasks can override the executor, validator, and planning lanes with per-task model fields (`modelProvider`/`modelId`, `validatorModelProvider`/`validatorModelId`, `planningModelProvider`/`planningModelId`).

**Precedence:** Per-task → Project override → Global lane → `defaultProvider`/`defaultModelId` → Automatic resolution.

For full settings documentation, see [Settings Reference](./docs/settings-reference.md).

### Scheduled tasks / automations

Fusion supports scheduled task automation via the `/api/automations` endpoints. Automations can run shell commands or multi-step workflows on a configurable schedule.

#### Scheduling scope

Automations and routines can run in two scopes:

- **Global** — Runs across all projects. Use this for cross-project maintenance, backups, or unified reporting.
- **Project** — Runs only within a specific project. Use this for project-specific CI, testing, or deployment tasks.

When you create a schedule without choosing a scope, Fusion defaults to **project scope** with the `default` project ID for backward compatibility.

To explicitly target a scope:
- In the dashboard **Scheduled Tasks** modal, use the **Global / Project** toggle.
- Via the API, pass `?scope=global` or `?scope=project&projectId=<id>` on automation/routine endpoints.

**Scope resolution rules:**
- `scope=global` always resolves to the global automation/routine lane, independent of the active project.
- `scope=project` requires a `projectId`. If omitted, it falls back to `"default"`.
- CRUD, run, toggle, and webhook operations are strictly scope-isolated: a global schedule cannot be mutated from a project-scoped request, and vice versa.

**Operational guidance for multi-project setups:**
- Prefer **global** schedules for shared infrastructure (e.g., nightly backups, memory insight extraction).
- Prefer **project** schedules for per-repository automation (e.g., per-project test runners, deployment hooks).
- Global and project lanes are polled independently by the engine, so due runs in one lane do not block the other.

#### Automations

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/automations` | GET | List all automations (filtered by scope if specified) |
| `/api/automations` | POST | Create automation (scope defaults to `project`) |
| `/api/automations/:id` | GET | Get automation by ID |
| `/api/automations/:id` | PATCH | Update automation |
| `/api/automations/:id` | DELETE | Delete automation |
| `/api/automations/:id/run` | POST | Trigger manual run |
| `/api/automations/:id/toggle` | POST | Toggle enabled/disabled |
| `/api/automations/:id/steps/reorder` | POST | Reorder automation steps |

#### Routines

Routines are AI agent tasks triggered by cron schedules, webhooks, or manual execution. Routines share the same global/project scope model as automations.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/routines` | GET | List all routines (filtered by scope if specified) |
| `/api/routines` | POST | Create routine (scope defaults to `project`) |
| `/api/routines/:id` | GET | Get routine by ID |
| `/api/routines/:id` | PATCH | Update routine |
| `/api/routines/:id` | DELETE | Delete routine |
| `/api/routines/:id/run` | POST | Manual trigger |
| `/api/routines/:id/trigger` | POST | Canonical manual trigger |
| `/api/routines/:id/runs` | GET | Get execution history |
| `/api/routines/:id/webhook` | POST | Webhook trigger (signature verification supported) |
