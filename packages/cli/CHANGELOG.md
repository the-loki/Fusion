# @runfusion/fusion

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 25d44e1: Add interactive TUI to `fn dashboard` with five navigable sections: logs, system, utilities, stats, and settings. Keyboard shortcuts enable quick in-terminal navigation (1-5, arrows, q, Ctrl+C, ? for help). The TUI activates automatically in interactive terminal sessions; non-TTY mode (CI, piped output) retains the existing plain-text banner/log behavior.

### Patch Changes

- a2ed6d0: Fixes for stuck merges and agent lifecycle controls.

  - `findLandedTaskCommit` now falls back to scanning all of `HEAD` when the bounded `baseCommitSha..HEAD` range returns no commits (e.g. baseCommitSha was advanced past the landed merge by a fast-forward rebase). Previously the recovery silently returned null and re-queued the merge even though the commit had already landed.
  - Agent heartbeat triggers and registration are gated by `runtimeConfig.enabled` rather than transient agent state, so paused/idle/error agents stay registered for triggers and re-arm immediately on resume without waiting for a state transition.
  - `AgentDetailView` exposes a Stop control alongside Pause/Retry for `running` and `error` states so operators can terminate stuck agents without going through the agents list.

## 0.0.6

### Patch Changes

- Re-ship three previously reverted fixes and add pre-merge remote rebase.

  - `--no-auth` flag now correctly suppresses bearer-token auth instead of being silently overridden by a stale `FUSION_DAEMON_TOKEN` in the project's `.env`.
  - Workflow-review revisions reopen only the last step rather than resetting every previously-completed step. The agent applies the feedback as an in-place fix and earlier approved work stays done. New `reopenLastStepForRevision` helper is used by `handleWorkflowRevisionRequest`, `handleWorkflowStepFailure`, and `sendTaskBackForFix`. `determineRevisionResetStart` is marked `@deprecated` and kept exported for tests.
  - Heartbeat scheduling is now driven by `agent.state` (`active`/`running` = timer armed; everything else = timer cleared), not `runtimeConfig.enabled`. Resuming a paused agent through the dashboard now re-arms the timer immediately.
  - New setting `worktreeRebaseBeforeMerge` (default `true`) and companion `worktreeRebaseRemote` (default: git's configured default). The merger fetches the remote and rebases the task branch onto the latest default-branch tip before merging; conflicts flow into the existing smart/AI resolve cascade. Dashboard Settings → Worktrees exposes a checkbox and a remote dropdown populated from `/api/git/remotes/detailed`.
  - Last/Next heartbeat labels on the agent list card now share font-size and inline-flex alignment so they line up cleanly.

## 0.0.5

### Patch Changes

- 41553a5: Harden agent lifecycle around closed tasks and heartbeat defaults.

  - `HeartbeatMonitor.executeHeartbeat()` now exits before session creation when the resolved task is done/archived (reason `task_closed`) and clears the stale `agent.taskId` linkage so the guard isn't re-tripped on every tick.
  - `HeartbeatTriggerScheduler.watchAssignments()` skips callback dispatch when the assigned task is already closed (when a `taskStore` is wired in).
  - `POST /api/agents/:id/runs` performs the same preflight check and returns 409 with a structured error naming the task id + column, keeping the existing active-run 409 precedence.
  - `AgentStore.createAgent()` now persists `runtimeConfig.heartbeatIntervalMs` (default 1h) on non-ephemeral agents so the dashboard's freshness signal matches the scheduler's effective cadence instead of depending on whether the user ever opened the heartbeat dropdown. Exports a new `DEFAULT_AGENT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` constant.

## 0.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 0da498a: Fix dashboard onboarding auth token controls, keep the AI planning modal footer visible on desktop, and add better terminal PTY spawn diagnostics.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 1fc72d1: Improve the dashboard agents list views with shared empty-state actions, token-based state styling, and clearer board/tree/org-chart presentation.
- 46b8032: Make `fn agent import` import package skills alongside agents when importing from directory or archive sources. Skills are written to `{project}/skills/imported/{company-slug}/{skill-slug}/SKILL.md` with proper frontmatter formatting. Existing skill files are skipped rather than overwritten. Single AGENTS.md file imports do not include package skills.
- c1bc5b9: Fix CLI merge regressions in test/build verification: restore gh-cli test alias resolution, ensure daemon ignores invalid env tokens, and restore required changeset config.
- 06704cf: Fix the setup wizard directory browser and make terminal session startup more resilient.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Add `fusion` bin alias so `npx @runfusion/fusion` resolves to the CLI
  (the `fn` command is still available and unchanged).

## 0.0.1

### Initial release

First public release under the `@runfusion` scope. Package was previously
developed under the `@gsxdsm/fusion` name; it was never published to npm,
so version history resets with `0.0.1`. Pre-release notes preserved below
for reference.

---

## 0.4.0 (pre-release, unpublished)

### Minor Changes

- 2d13b82: Add pi extension. Installing `@runfusion/fusion` via `pi install` now provides native tools (`fn_task_create`, `fn_task_list`, `fn_task_show`, `fn_task_attach`, `fn_task_pause`, `fn_task_unpause`) and a `/fn` command to start the dashboard and AI engine from within a pi session.
- 494de14: Changed `autoMerge` to default to `true` for new boards.
- 50821fc: Add global pause button to stop all automated agents and scheduling
- cac10af: Split engine control into Pause (soft) and Stop (hard). The dashboard Header now shows two buttons: "Pause AI engine" stops new work from being dispatched while letting in-flight agents finish gracefully, and "Stop AI engine" (previously the only Pause button) immediately kills all active agent sessions. A new `enginePaused` setting field controls the soft-pause state alongside the existing `globalPause` hard-stop.

### Patch Changes

- d19b51f: Auto-assign random port when dashboard port is already in use instead of crashing with EADDRINUSE.
- ceb379d: Engine pause now terminates active agent sessions (matching global pause behavior) instead of letting them finish gracefully. Tasks are moved back to todo/cleared for clean resume on unpause.
- acb246a: Fix active agent glow disappearing when scheduling is soft-paused
- 43aada5: Fix scheduler to not count in-review worktrees against maxWorktrees limit. In-review tasks are idle (waiting to merge) and no longer block new tasks from starting.
- 9033a79: Fix InlineCreateCard cancelling when clicking dependency dropdown items with empty description.
- 96f1070: Fix double horizontal scrollbar on mobile board view by switching the board from a 5-column grid to a flex layout on narrow viewports (≤768px) with snap-scrolling.
- 3dc741c: Fix auto-pause on rate limit when pi-coding-agent exhausts retries. After `session.prompt()` resolves with exhausted retries, all four agent types (executor, triage, merger, reviewer) now detect the error on `session.state.error` and trigger `UsageLimitPauser` to activate global pause. Previously, rate-limit errors that pi-coding-agent handled internally were silently swallowed, causing tasks to be promoted to wrong columns with incomplete work.
- 2854553: Fix triage allowing tasks to reach executor before spec review approval
- 72a8953: Fix specifying agents not respecting maxConcurrent concurrency limit
- a2a12f9: Persist worktree pool across engine restarts. When `recycleWorktrees` is enabled, idle worktrees are rehydrated from disk on startup instead of being forgotten. When disabled, orphaned worktrees are cleaned up automatically.
- 65b9585: Add priority-based agent scheduling: merge agents are served before execution agents, which are served before specification agents, when competing for concurrency slots.
- 98ed082: Restructure README to lead with pi extension usage; move standalone CLI docs to STANDALONE.md.
- 2d13b82: Agents now declare dependencies when creating multiple related tasks during execution
- 0e0643a: Skip merger agent when squash merge stages nothing (branch already merged via dependency)
- d2e2e50: Make "Pause AI engine" a soft pause: only prevents new agents from starting while allowing currently running agents to finish their work naturally. "Stop AI engine" (global pause) still immediately terminates all active agents.
- 90764b9: Auto-pause engine when API usage limits are detected (rate limits, overloaded, quota exceeded). Prevents wasteful retries across concurrent agents.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- ae90be0: Bundle workspace packages into CLI for npm publish. The published package previously declared dependencies on private `@kb/core`, `@kb/dashboard`, and `@kb/engine` workspace packages, causing `npm install` to fail. Switched the CLI build from `tsc` to `tsup` (esbuild) to inline all `@kb/*` workspace code into a single bundled `dist/bin.js`, while keeping third-party packages (`express`, `multer`, `@mariozechner/pi-ai`) as external dependencies. Dashboard client assets are now copied into `dist/client/` so the published tarball is fully self-contained.
- 28bbcb9: Exclude Bun-compiled platform binaries from npm publish tarball, reducing package size significantly.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fc7582d: Expand agent.log logging to all agent types, additionally capturing thinking, and agent roles
- cc999ef: RETHINK verdicts trigger git reset and conversation rewind, re-prompting the agent with feedback

### Patch Changes

- f3c7f7d: CLI `task create` now supports a `--depends <id>` flag (repeatable) to declare task dependencies at creation time.
- fc7582d: Code review REVISE verdicts are now enforced such that agents can no longer advance steps without APPROVE
- cc999ef: Plan RETHINK triggers conversation rewind with REVISE enforcement on code reviews
- cc999ef: Dependent tasks can start from in-review dependency branches instead of waiting for merge

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- efdb7de: Clean up README: plain ASCII file tree, mermaid workflow diagram with column descriptions, update quick start to use `kb` CLI, add authentication section to CLI README, document cross-model review in executor description.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b12d340: Add automated versioning pipeline using changesets. Developers now add changeset files to describe changes, and a CI workflow automatically opens version PRs that bump versions and generate changelogs.
