# Project Guidelines

## Finalizing changes

When making changes that affect published packages, create a changeset file:

```bash
cat > .changeset/<short-description>.md << 'EOF'
---
"@dustinbyrne/kb": patch
---

Short description of the change.
EOF
```

Bump types:

- **patch**: bug fixes, internal changes
- **minor**: new features, new CLI commands, new tools
- **major**: breaking changes

Include the changeset file in the same commit as the code change. The filename should be a short kebab-case description (e.g. `fix-merge-conflict.md`, `add-retry-button.md`).

Only create changesets for changes that affect the published `@dustinbyrne/kb` package — user-facing features, bug fixes, CLI changes, tool changes. Do NOT create changesets for internal docs (AGENTS.md, README), CI config, or refactors that don't change behavior.

## Package Structure

- `@kb/core` — domain model, task store (private, not published)
- `@kb/dashboard` — web UI + API server (private, not published)
- `@kb/engine` — AI agents: triage, executor, reviewer, merger, scheduler (private, not published)
- `@dustinbyrne/kb` — CLI + pi extension (published to npm)

Only `@dustinbyrne/kb` is published. The others are internal workspace packages.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test          # run all tests
pnpm build         # build all packages
```

Tests are required. Typechecks and manual verification are not substitutes for real tests with assertions.

## Pi Extension (`packages/cli/src/extension.ts`)

The pi extension provides tools and a `/kb` command for interacting with kb from within a pi session. It ships as part of `@dustinbyrne/kb` — one `pi install` gives you both the CLI and the extension.

Update it when:

- **CLI commands change** — if `kb task create`, `kb task list`, `kb task show`, `kb task attach`, `kb task pause`, or `kb task unpause` change their behavior, flags, or output, update the corresponding tool in `packages/cli/src/extension.ts`.
- **Task store API changes** — the extension calls `TaskStore` directly (`createTask`, `listTasks`, `getTask`, `addAttachment`, `pauseTask`). If these methods change signature or behavior, update the extension.
- **New user-facing features** — if a new CLI command is added that the chat agent should be able to use (task creation, status checking, automation control), add a tool for it.

**Don't** add tools for engine-internal operations (move, step updates, logging, merge) — those are handled by the engine's own agents.

The extension has no skills — tool descriptions, `promptSnippet`, and `promptGuidelines` give the LLM everything it needs.

## Dashboard badge WebSockets

GitHub PR and issue badges in the dashboard now have a dedicated real-time WebSocket channel at `/api/ws`.

### Frontend hook: `packages/dashboard/app/hooks/useBadgeWebSocket.ts`

Use `useBadgeWebSocket()` when a UI surface needs live badge snapshots for specific tasks.

- The hook uses a **shared singleton socket** so multiple `TaskCard` instances do not open duplicate WebSocket connections.
- Subscribe with `subscribeToBadge(taskId)` only when the card is visible and already has `prInfo` and/or `issueInfo`.
- Always pair subscriptions with `unsubscribeFromBadge(taskId)` on unmount or when the card leaves the viewport.
- Treat websocket payloads as **timestamped badge snapshots**. Merge them with task data using freshness comparisons so stale cached websocket data does not override newer SSE/task state.
- Preserve omitted fields on partial updates; only treat explicit `null` payloads as badge clears.

### Server-side expectations

- `/api/ws` is badge-specific; do **not** reuse it for general task updates.
- Badge broadcasts should contain only `prInfo` / `issueInfo` snapshot data, never full task objects.
- Badge updates are now **push-based via GitHub App webhooks** at `POST /api/github/webhooks`.
- The server verifies webhook signatures using `KB_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, fetches canonical badge state with GitHub App installation tokens, and broadcasts updates via the existing `task:updated` → `/api/ws` bridge.
- Keep the existing 5-minute refresh endpoints (`/api/tasks/:id/pr/status`, `/api/tasks/:id/issue/status`) as a fallback path when webhook delivery is unavailable.

## Git

- Commit messages: `feat(KB-XXX):`, `fix(KB-XXX):`, `test(KB-XXX):`
- One commit per step (not per file change)
- Always include the task ID prefix

## Settings

The following settings are available in the kb configuration (stored in `.kb/config.json`):

### `autoResolveConflicts` (default: `true`)

When enabled, the auto-merge system will intelligently resolve common merge conflict patterns without requiring manual intervention:

- **Lock files** (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `Gemfile.lock`, etc.) — automatically resolved using the current branch's version ("ours")
- **Generated files** (`*.gen.ts`, `dist/*`, `coverage/*`, etc.) — automatically resolved using the branch's fresh generation ("theirs")
- **Trivial conflicts** (whitespace-only differences) — automatically resolved

When a merge encounters conflicts and the AI agent fails to resolve them on the first attempt, the system implements a 3-attempt retry logic with escalating strategies:

1. **Attempt 1**: Standard merge with AI agent using full context
2. **Attempt 2**: Auto-resolve lock/generated files, then retry AI with simplified context
3. **Attempt 3**: Use `git merge -X theirs` strategy for remaining conflicts

If all 3 attempts fail, the task remains in "in-review" for manual resolution. The per-task retry counter (`mergeRetries`) tracks how many attempts have been made.

To disable automatic conflict resolution and require manual intervention for all conflicts:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "autoResolveConflicts": false
  }
}
```

### `smartConflictResolution` (default: `true`)

Alias for `autoResolveConflicts`. When enabled, enables automatic resolution of:
- Lock files using "ours" strategy (keep current branch's version)
- Generated files using "theirs" strategy (keep branch's fresh generation)  
- Trivial whitespace conflicts via `git diff-tree -w`

This setting is preferred for new configurations. If both settings are present, `smartConflictResolution` takes precedence.

### `requirePlanApproval` (default: `false`)

When enabled, AI-generated task specifications require manual approval before the task can move from "triage" to "todo". 

**How it works:**
- After the AI reviewer approves a specification, instead of automatically moving to "todo", the task remains in "triage" with status `"awaiting-approval"`
- Users can review the PROMPT.md in the task detail modal
- Users can click "Approve Plan" to move the task to "todo" and begin execution
- Users can click "Reject Plan" to discard the specification and trigger regeneration

To enable manual plan approval:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "requirePlanApproval": true
  }
}
```

### `ntfyEnabled` (default: `false`)

When true, enables ntfy.sh push notifications for task completion and failures.

**Notification events:**
- Task moves to "in-review" — "Task completed — ready for review"
- Task moves to "done" — "Task merged to main"
- Task status becomes "failed" — "Task failed" (high priority)

**Configuration:**
1. Go to https://ntfy.sh and pick a unique topic name (or self-host ntfy)
2. Open dashboard Settings → Notifications
3. Enable notifications and enter your topic name
4. Install the ntfy app on your phone/desktop and subscribe to your topic

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "ntfyEnabled": true,
    "ntfyTopic": "my-kb-notifications"
  }
}
```

**Notes:**
- No authentication required for public topics (keep it simple)
- Topic must be 1–64 alphanumeric/hyphen/underscore characters
- Notifications are best-effort: failures are logged but don't block task execution

### `taskStuckTimeoutMs` (default: `undefined` — disabled)

Timeout in milliseconds for detecting stuck tasks. When a task's agent session shows no activity (no text deltas, tool calls, or progress updates) for longer than this duration, the task is considered stuck and will be terminated and retried.

**How it works:**
- The `StuckTaskDetector` polls tracked in-progress tasks every 30 seconds
- When no agent activity is detected for longer than `taskStuckTimeoutMs`, the detector:
  1. Terminates the stuck agent session
  2. Logs the event to the task log
  3. Moves the task back to "todo" (preserving current step progress)
  4. The scheduler picks it up for retry, resuming from where it left off

**Suggested value:** `600000` (10 minutes)

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "taskStuckTimeoutMs": 600000
  }
}
```

**Notes:**
- When `undefined` (default), stuck task detection is completely disabled
- Activity is tracked on text deltas, tool calls, tool results, and step status updates
- Recovery preserves step progress — the task resumes from the current step, not from scratch
- Paused tasks are automatically untracked from monitoring
- The timeout is read from settings on every poll cycle, so changes take effect immediately

### `worktreeNaming` (default: `"random"`)

Controls how worktree directory names are generated when `recycleWorktrees` is NOT enabled. This setting only affects fresh worktrees (not pooled/recycled ones).

**Valid values:**
- `"random"` — Human-friendly random names like `swift-falcon`, `calm-river` (default)
- `"task-id"` — Use the task ID as the directory name, e.g., `kb-042`
- `"task-title"` — Use a slugified version of the task title, e.g., `fix-login-bug`

**Example:**
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "worktreeNaming": "task-id"
  }
}
```

**Notes:**
- This setting has no effect when `recycleWorktrees` is enabled (pooled worktrees retain their existing names)
- Task branches are always named `kb/{task-id}` regardless of this setting
- When using `"task-title"` mode, special characters are replaced with hyphens and the result is lowercased

## Per-Task Model Overrides

The kb dashboard allows overriding the global AI model selection on a per-task basis. This enables using different models for different types of work without changing global settings.

### How It Works

Each task can optionally specify:
- **Executor Model**: The AI model used to implement the task (executor agent)
- **Validator Model**: The AI model used to review code and plans (reviewer agent)

When not specified, tasks use the global default settings (`defaultProvider`/`defaultModelId`).

### Setting Per-Task Models

In the dashboard, open any task's detail modal and click the **Model** tab. Select models from the dropdown:
- **Use default**: Uses the global default model (shown when no override is set)
- **Specific model**: Override with a chosen provider/model combination

Both provider and model ID must be selected together — selecting only one is treated as "not set" and falls back to defaults.

### Storage

Per-task model overrides are stored in the task's `task.json`:
```json
{
  "modelProvider": "anthropic",
  "modelId": "claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "validatorModelProvider": "openai",
  "validatorModelId": "gpt-4o"
}
```

To clear overrides, select "Use default" for both fields and save.

### Engine Behavior

- **Executor**: When both `modelProvider` and `modelId` are set on a task, the executor uses those instead of global settings when creating the agent session.
- **Reviewer**: When both `validatorModelProvider` and `validatorModelId` are set, the reviewer uses those instead of global settings. The validator model is passed via `ReviewOptions` to `reviewStep()`.

### Limitations

- Triage (task specification) always uses global defaults — per-task overrides apply only to execution and review
- Both provider and modelId must be set together; partial configuration falls back to defaults

## Archive Cleanup

Archived tasks can be cleaned up from the filesystem to reduce storage overhead while preserving the ability to restore them later.

### Storage Pattern

When a task is archived and cleaned up:
1. A compact entry is written to `.kb/archive.jsonl` (JSON Lines format)
2. The task directory (`task.json`, `PROMPT.md`, `agent.log`, attachments) is removed
3. The archive entry contains all metadata needed to restore the task

The archive log is append-only and survives TaskStore reinitialization.

### Archive Entry Format

Each line in `archive.jsonl` is a JSON object containing:
- `id`, `title`, `description`, `column` (always "archived")
- `dependencies`, `steps`, `currentStep`
- `size`, `reviewLevel`, `prInfo`, `issueInfo`
- `attachments` (metadata only, no file content)
- `log` (task log entries)
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `columnMovedAt`, `archivedAt`
- Model overrides: `modelProvider`, `modelId`, `validatorModelProvider`, `validatorModelId`

**Explicitly excluded:** `agent.log` content (can be large, not needed for restoration)

### API

- `archiveTask(id, cleanup)` — Archive with optional immediate cleanup
- `archiveTaskAndCleanup(id)` — Convenience method for archive + cleanup
- `cleanupArchivedTasks()` — Bulk cleanup of all archived tasks with directories
- `readArchiveLog()` — Parse all archive entries
- `findInArchive(id)` — Find specific task in archive
- `unarchiveTask(id)` — Restore from archive if directory is missing

### Restoration Behavior

When `unarchiveTask()` is called:
1. If task directory exists: normal unarchive (column "archived" → "done")
2. If directory missing: restore from archive entry first, then unarchive
3. Restored tasks have:
   - All metadata preserved
   - `column` set to "done" (was "archived" in the log)
   - `PROMPT.md` regenerated with preserved steps
   - Empty `attachments/` directory (files intentionally lost)
   - No `agent.log` (intentionally lost during archive)
   - Log entry: "Task restored from archive"

### Cleanup Behavior

- `cleanupArchivedTasks()` iterates all "archived" column tasks
- Skips tasks already cleaned up (directory gone)
- Writes archive entry atomically before directory removal
- Can be called idempotently
