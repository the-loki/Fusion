/**
 * These tests exercise the real probe — we deliberately do NOT mock
 * `spawn`. The probe's job is to tell the truth about the local system,
 * and mocking defeats that. Instead we:
 *
 *   1. Assert the shape is sound regardless of binary availability
 *   2. Assert timeouts fire when the binary hangs (we don't have a
 *      hanging binary fixture, so we cover the structural case only)
 *   3. Let the suite pass whether or not `claude` is installed on the
 *      test runner — both outcomes are legitimate.
 *
 * If you need mocked probe behavior for a higher-level route test, spy
 * on `probeClaudeCli` at the import boundary rather than shimming spawn.
