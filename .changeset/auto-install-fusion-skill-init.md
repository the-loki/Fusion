"@runfusion/fusion": patch
---

Automatically install the bundled Fusion skill into supported agent home directories during `fn init` (`~/.claude/skills/fusion`, `~/.codex/skills/fusion`, and `~/.gemini/skills/fusion`) when missing. Existing installs are preserved, and per-target filesystem errors now warn without failing project initialization.
