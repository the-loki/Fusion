/**
 * Resolver for the vendored `@fusion/pi-claude-cli` pi extension.
 *
 * `@fusion/pi-claude-cli` is a workspace package at `packages/pi-claude-cli/`,
 * a soft fork of rchern/pi-claude-cli (see that package's UPSTREAM.md). It
 * ships its extension entry as raw `.ts` source — pi's loader compiles TS on
 * the fly via jiti, so we just need to point pi at the right file.
 *
 * We deliberately do NOT auto-add "npm:@fusion/pi-claude-cli" to the user's
 * ~/.fusion/agent/settings.json packages array. The package is resolved from
 * this workspace at runtime and loaded explicitly only when
 * GlobalSettings.useClaudeCli is true — this avoids polluting user-owned
 * config files and lets us gate the extension on a UI toggle without
 * settings.json churn.

 * Implementation notes:
 *   - `require.resolve("@fusion/pi-claude-cli/package.json")` is the canonical way
 *     to find a package's root from a dependent module without importing the
 *     package itself. It respects pnpm's strict layout.
 *   - We read pi.extensions[0] from the package.json rather than assuming
 *     a fixed filename; if upstream renames the entry we still work.
 *   - `createRequire(import.meta.url)` anchors resolution to this module's
 *     physical location, not `process.cwd()`, so the dep is found wherever
 *     `@runfusion/fusion` itself is installed.
