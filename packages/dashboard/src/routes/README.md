# Dashboard API route registrars

`packages/dashboard/src/routes.ts` remains the single public entrypoint (`createApiRoutes(store, options)`), but route definitions are registered by domain modules in this directory.

## Shared context contract

All registrars receive `ApiRoutesContext` from `./types.ts`, built by `createApiRoutesContext()` in `./context.ts`.

Registrars should be typed as `ApiRouteRegistrar` so modules share one explicit registration contract.

The context centralizes cross-cutting dependencies so registrars preserve behavior without re-implementing plumbing.

Some registrars (for example `register-task-workflow-routes.ts`) also take a narrow dependency-injection object for non-context helpers that must stay source-of-truth in `routes.ts` (git helpers, background refresh helpers, multer upload middleware). This avoids helper duplication while preserving runtime parity.

The context provides core cross-cutting plumbing:

- Request/project scoping: `getProjectIdFromRequest`, `getScopedStore`, `getProjectContext`
  - These are also exported from `context.ts` as canonical helpers for future extraction tasks.
- Engine-aware fallback behavior for project-bound and root-store APIs
- Runtime loggers and diagnostics emitters (`runtimeLogger`, `planningLogger`, `proxyLogger`, `chatLogger`)
- Proxy/auth/audit helpers (`proxyToRemoteNode`, `emitRemoteRouteDiagnostic`, `emitAuthSyncAuditLog`)
- Automation/routine resolvers and scope parsing helpers
- Shared error normalization (`rethrowAsApiError`)

## Ordering rules (critical)

Express matches in registration order. Keep registrar and in-registrar route ordering stable:

1. **Specific operation routes before generic parameterized routes** (`/runs`, `/runs/:id`, `/copy`, `/delete` before `/:id` style handlers)
2. **Specific operation routes before wildcard paths** (`/files/{*filepath}/copy|move|delete|rename|download|download-zip` before `POST /files/{*filepath}`)
   - Why: Express route matching is first-win. If the wildcard write route is registered first, paths like `/files/somefolder/delete` will be treated as file writes instead of delete operations.
3. **Do not move proxy/script/message/file wildcards ahead of specific routes**
4. **Project/node/sync/discovery ordering constraints must stay intact**:
   - `/projects/across-nodes` and `/projects/detect` must be registered before `/projects/:id`
   - `/nodes/:id/settings` must be registered before `/nodes/:id/settings/push|pull|sync-status` and before `/nodes/:id/auth/sync`
   - `/mesh/state` must be registered before `/mesh/sync`
   - Discovery routes stay grouped after mesh routes
   - Inbound `/settings/sync-receive|auth-receive|auth-export` routes mount after discovery routes
5. **Auth/model/usage ordering constraints must stay intact**:
   - Keep `/models` registration before auth-dependent picker/settings flows that rely on consistent model filtering
   - Keep auth registrar routes grouped as currently mounted (status/diagnostic + mutation endpoints) so no wildcard handler can shadow `/providers/claude-cli/status`
   - Keep `/usage` mounted as a standalone registrar route (not under auth paths) with unchanged error mapping semantics
6. **Agent ordering constraints must stay intact**:
   - `/agents/stats`, `/agents/org-tree`, `/agents/resolve/:shortname` before `/agents/:id`
   - `/agents/:id/runs/stop` before `/agents/:id/runs/:runId`
   - `/agents/:id/reflections/latest` before `/agents/:id/reflections`

If adding a new endpoint, place it in the domain registrar and verify it does not shadow existing handlers.

## Integrated routers

Integrated routers are mounted through `register-integrated-routers.ts` and intentionally called from `routes.ts` at precedence-sensitive points:

- `registerIntegratedRouters(...)` mounts:
  - `createMissionRouter` → `/api/missions`
  - `createRoadmapRouter` → `/api/roadmaps`
  - `createInsightsRouter` → `/api/insights`
- `registerIntegratedDevServerRouter(...)` mounts:
  - `createDevServerRouter` → `/api/dev-server`

Keep these calls in their current positions inside `createApiRoutes()` unless an explicit route-ordering migration is planned and regression-tested.
