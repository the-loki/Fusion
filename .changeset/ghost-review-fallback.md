Add ghost-review fallback recovery to the self-healing maintenance loop. Catches any `in-review` task that fell through every more-specific recovery scan and has been idle past `taskStuckTimeoutMs`, kicks it back to `todo` with transient status cleared. Preserves human-handoff (`awaiting-user-review`, `awaiting-approval`) and active-merge (`merging`, `merging-pr`) statuses; rate-limited naturally by `updatedAt` refresh so a re-stuck task can only be kicked once per timeout window.
