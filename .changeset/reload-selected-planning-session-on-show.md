Always reload the selected planning session into the right pane when the planning screen is shown. Previously the reload was skipped if an SSE stream was still connected, so a stream that survived close (or one re-established before the reload effect ran) could leave the right view divergent from the sidebar selection. `loadSession` already tears down and reconnects the stream, so the guard was unnecessary; dropping it makes close+reopen — and any other show transition — deterministically refresh the detail view from the server.
