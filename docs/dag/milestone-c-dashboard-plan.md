# Milestone C: DAG dashboard surfacing plan

Related tasks: **FN-4487**, **FN-4471**, **FN-4490**, **FN-4491**, **FN-4492**.

## Constraints & Governance

> "Do not file, plan, or implement tasks that adjust button mobile-responsiveness, touch-target sizing, or mobile reflow of header/action button rows anywhere in the dashboard (TaskCard, SettingsModal, ChatView, MissionManager, AgentsView, FAB, etc.). **Keep buttons as they are.**"

> "Reliability mechanism changes are currently under freeze pending FN-4359 governance hardening; treat new reliability-layer behavior changes as blocked unless explicitly approved in task scope."

This document is planning-only. No runtime behavior, scheduler/executor/merger code, dashboard routes, API endpoints, or schema changes are made here.

## UX Progression (debug → operator)

### Stage 1 — Debug surface

**Audience:** Fusion developers debugging prototype orchestration.

**Ship:** Read-only structured-log view for `[dag-coordinator]` events, filterable by `runId`, mirroring `AgentLogViewer` / `ActivityFeed` interaction patterns.

**Operator questions answered:**
- Did this DAG run start and finish/abort?
- Which node was enqueued/completed/failed most recently?
- What failure reason code was emitted for the failing node/run?

**Events consumed from FN-4490 contract:**
- `dag:run:start`
- `dag:node:enqueue`
- `dag:node:complete`
- `dag:node:fail`
- `dag:run:complete`
- `dag:run:abort`

### Stage 2 — Run inspector

**Audience:** Power users monitoring multi-task DAG runs.

**Ship:** Per-run detail inspector with node table, dependency/blocked context, and task deep-links into `TaskDetailModal`; read-only.

**Operator questions answered:**
- Which DAG node failed and why?
- Which nodes are complete vs still pending/in-progress?
- Which Fusion task corresponds to each node and where do I inspect logs/details?

**Events consumed from FN-4490 contract:**
- `dag:run:start`
- `dag:node:enqueue`
- `dag:node:complete`
- `dag:node:fail`
- `dag:run:complete`
- `dag:run:abort`

### Stage 3 — Operator surface

**Audience:** End-users orchestrating DAG runs.

**Ship:** Top-level run list, per-run graph visualization (nodes + edges), run-state summary, and pause/resume/cancel controls.

**Operator questions answered:**
- Is this run still making progress or stalled?
- Which branch/path of the graph failed and what is downstream impact?
- Can I safely pause/resume/cancel without violating task ownership or merge safety?

**Events consumed from FN-4490 contract:**
- `dag:run:start`
- `dag:node:enqueue`
- `dag:node:complete`
- `dag:node:fail`
- `dag:run:complete`
- `dag:run:abort`

#### Events to add in FN-4490 follow-up

Stage 3 controls need explicit pause/resume observability. FN-4490 currently defines only `dag:run:abort` (not pause/resume), so add:
- `dag:run:pause`
- `dag:run:resume`

These are follow-up requirements and are not introduced as implemented behavior in this task.

## Views & Controls

| Surface name | Stage | Mount point | Data source (proposed) | Reused components/classes | New tokens required | Lazy-load decision | Mobile reflow plan |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DagRunDebugFeed` | 1 | `DagRunDetailModal` in `packages/dashboard/app/components/AppModals.tsx` | `GET /api/dag/runs/:id/events` backed by `DagCoordinator` run-event stream | `AgentLogViewer`, `ActivityFeed`, `.card`, `.input` | none | Modal code-split with existing `AppModals.tsx` lazy modal pattern; no eager heavy bundle | Only non-button layout wrapping at `@media (max-width: 768px)`; control buttons unchanged per Buttons Frozen |
| `DagRunDetailModal` | 2 | New modal wired in `AppModals.tsx` | `GET /api/dag/runs/:id` + `GET /api/dag/runs/:id/nodes` from `DagCoordinator` read model | `.modal`, `.modal-lg`, `.card`, `.card-status-badge--{status}`, `.input`, `TaskDetailModal` deep-link behavior | none | Lazy modal import via `React.lazy()` + `<Suspense fallback={null}>` | Non-button table/graph stacking only; no `.btn` size/reflow edits |
| `DagNodeDetailPanel` | 2 | Child panel inside `DagRunDetailModal` | `GET /api/dag/runs/:id/nodes/:nodeId` from `DagCoordinator` | `.card`, `.card-meta`, `.card-status-badge--{status}`, `linkifyFilePaths`, `FileBrowserContext` | none | Bundled with `DagRunDetailModal` chunk (no separate eager load) | Non-button typography/spacing adjustments only in component CSS mobile block |
| `DagRunsView` | 3 | New top-level view in `packages/dashboard/app/App.tsx` nav/view registry | `GET /api/dag/runs` from `DagCoordinator` run list read model | `.card`, `.card-header`, `.card-id`, `.card-status-badge--{status}`, `.input`, `.btn`, `.btn-sm`, `.btn-warning`, `.btn-danger` | none | Required heavy-view lazy load: `React.lazy()` + `prefetchLazyViews()` warm-up registration | Card/grid/list non-button layout reflow only; action-button row unchanged per Buttons Frozen |
| `DagRunGraphPanel` | 3 | Section within `DagRunDetailModal` (opened from `DagRunsView`) | `GET /api/dag/runs/:id/graph` from `DagCoordinator` graph projection | `.card`, status tokens (`--triage`, `--todo`, `--in-progress`, `--in-review`, `--done`), `ConfirmDialog` for destructive control confirmation handoff | `--dag-graph-edge` (semantic), `--dag-graph-node-shadow` (semantic), `--dag-graph-active-ring` (semantic) | Included in Stage 3 lazy chunks (`DagRunsView`/`DagRunDetailModal`) and prefetched with other heavy views | Graph canvas/layout may reflow on mobile; button classes remain existing `.btn` chain with no touch-target inflation |

Notes:
- Stage mapping is complete across all Stage 1–3 surfaces.
- All status visuals reuse existing semantic status tokens and `--status-*-bg` conventions.
- No row introduces hardcoded px/hex/rgba contracts; implementation must remain token-driven.
- No row proposes button restyling, `.btn` min-height overrides, or mobile button-row reflow.

## Run Control Contract

### Pause

Pause means: stop enqueuing new DAG nodes for the run while allowing currently in-flight Fusion tasks to finish through their existing executor lease + merge path. Pause does **not** cancel running tasks mid-flight and does not mutate checkout ownership.

This preserves `AGENTS.md` checkout-leasing conflict semantics (409 ownership contention) and avoids violating merger file-scope protections (file-scope invariant remains authoritative).

### Resume

Resume means: re-enable node enqueueing for a paused run. Any node whose dependencies are now satisfied becomes eligible through the existing scheduler path defined by the FN-4490 ADR (`DagCoordinator` as upstream readiness producer into normal queueing/dispatch), with no direct scheduler-internal bypass.

### Cancel

Cancel means: stop future enqueueing, mark run aborted, and finalize run state with `dag:run:abort`. In-flight tasks may finish/fail naturally, but their outcomes do not trigger downstream nodes after cancellation.

Cancel explicitly does **not**:
- issue task moves (including `moveTask(in-progress → todo)`),
- cancel executor sessions mid-flight,
- bypass merger/workflow gates,
- alter user-initiated cancel contracts in `AGENTS.md` Engine Process Rules.

### UI affordance contract

- Controls are single buttons using existing classes only: `.btn`, `.btn-sm`, `.btn-warning`, `.btn-danger`.
- Cancel is destructive and must be confirmation-gated via `ConfirmDialog`.
- No new button styling, no button mobile reflow, and no touch-target inflation for these controls (Buttons Frozen directive applies).

### Proposed API surface (planning only)

- `POST /api/dag/runs/:id/pause`
- `POST /api/dag/runs/:id/resume`
- `POST /api/dag/runs/:id/cancel`

Success response shape (proposed): `{ ok: true, runId, state }`.
Illegal state transition: `409` (mirrors existing 409 conflict semantics).

Schema details, persistence model, and endpoint implementation are out-of-scope for FN-4492 and should be handled in FN-4491 / downstream Milestone C implementation.

### Observability + run-audit tie-in

- Control actions must emit DAG lifecycle events and run-audit mutations.
- `dag:run:abort` already exists in FN-4490 contract.
- `dag:run:pause` and `dag:run:resume` are required follow-up additions to FN-4490 vocabulary before implementation.
- Run-audit should record state transitions in database-domain audit entries per existing run-audit model.

### Explicit out-of-scope control behaviors

- No force-kill of running tasks
- No rollback of already-merged commits
- No automatic retry/replay of cancelled runs
- No cross-mesh fan-out cancellation
