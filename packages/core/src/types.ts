3. README files are updated if the task changes user-facing behavior
4. CHANGELOG or release notes are considered for significant changes
5. Type definitions are documented for public APIs

Files to Review:
- Review all files modified in the task worktree
- Focus on public API surface area
- Check test files for test documentation

Output Requirements:
- If documentation is adequate: call task_done() with success status
- If documentation is missing: list specific files and functions that need documentation using task_log()
- Provide specific suggestions for what documentation should be added`,

Test Execution:
1. Run the project's test suite (use pnpm test, npm test, or the configured test command)
2. Verify all tests pass
3. If tests fail, analyze whether failures are related to the task changes

Code Review:
1. Review the changes for obvious bugs or edge cases
2. Check error handling is appropriate
3. Verify input validation is present where needed
4. Look for common issues: null pointer risks, off-by-one errors, race conditions

Output Requirements:
- If all tests pass and no bugs found: call task_done() with success status
- If tests fail: provide detailed failure information via task_log()
- If bugs are found: describe the bug, affected files, and suggested fix via task_log()`,

Security Checklist:
1. **Injection vulnerabilities** — Check for SQL injection, command injection, XSS via unsanitized user input
2. **Secrets and credentials** — Ensure no hardcoded passwords, API keys, tokens, or private keys
3. **Unsafe eval** — Check for eval(), new Function(), or similar dangerous patterns
4. **Path traversal** — Verify file path handling prevents directory traversal attacks
5. **Insecure deserialization** — Check for unsafe parsing of untrusted data
6. **Authentication/Authorization** — Verify access controls are properly implemented
7. **Dependency risks** — Note any new dependencies that might have known vulnerabilities

Files to Review:
- All modified files in the task
- Configuration files that might contain secrets
- Areas handling user input or external data

Output Requirements:
- If no security issues found: call task_done() with success status
- If issues found: describe each vulnerability with specific file paths, line numbers, and severity via task_log()

3. **Memory leaks** — Check for unclosed resources, event listeners, or accumulating caches
4. **Unnecessary re-renders** — For UI code, check for inefficient React/Angular/Vue patterns
5. **Bundle size** — Note if large dependencies are added unnecessarily
6. **Async patterns** — Verify proper use of async/await, Promise.all for parallel work
7. **Caching opportunities** — Identify where caching could improve performance

Files to Review:

## Prerequisites
First, determine the URL to verify. Check the task PROMPT.md for any URLs mentioned, or look at the code changes to identify the local development server URL (typically http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:5173, http://localhost:8080, etc.).

## Verification Commands
Use these agent-browser commands for verification:
- \`agent-browser open <url>\` — Navigate to the page
- \`agent-browser snapshot -i\` — Get interactive elements with refs (@e1, @e2, etc.)
- \`agent-browser click @e1\` — Click an element
- \`agent-browser fill @e1 "text"\` — Fill an input field
- \`agent-browser get text @e1\` — Get element text content
- \`agent-browser screenshot\` — Capture screenshot to file
- \`agent-browser wait --load networkidle\` — Wait for page to fully load

## Verification Checklist
1. Page loads without JavaScript errors or blank screens
2. Navigation between pages/sections works
3. Forms accept input and submit correctly
4. Interactive elements (buttons, links) respond to clicks
5. Error states are handled gracefully
6. Screenshots capture expected content

## Output Requirements
- If verification succeeds: call task_done() with success status
- If verification fails: describe what failed and how it should behave via task_log()
- Include screenshots as evidence of verification results

Note: Refs (@e1, @e2) are invalidated after page navigation. Re-snapshot after clicking links or form submissions.`,
